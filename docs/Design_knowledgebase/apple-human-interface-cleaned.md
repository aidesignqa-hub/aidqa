# Accessibility

Accessible user interfaces empower everyone to have a great experience with your app or game.

![A sketch of the Accessibility icon. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/f7e408b21d156daa60c2e30c0bcff9e5/foundations-accessibility-intro%402x.png)

When you design for accessibility, you reach a larger audience and create a more inclusive experience. An accessible interface allows people to experience your app or game regardless of their capabilities or how they use their devices. Accessibility makes information and interactions available to everyone. An accessible interface is:

- **Intuitive.** Your interface uses familiar and consistent interactions that make tasks straightforward to perform.

- **Perceivable.** Your interface doesn’t rely on any single method to convey information. People can access and interact with your content, whether they use sight, hearing, speech, or touch.

- **Adaptable.** Your interface adapts to how people want to use their device, whether by supporting system accessibility features or letting people personalize settings.

As you design your app, audit the accessibility of your interface. Use [Accessibility Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility/accessibility-inspector) to highlight accessibility issues with your interface and to understand how your app represents itself to people using system accessibility features. You can also communicate how accessible your app is on the App Store using Accessibility Nutrition Labels. To learn more about how to evaluate and indicate accessibility feature support, see [Accessibility Nutrition Labels](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels) in App Store Connect help.

## [Vision](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility\#Vision)

![An illustration containing five symbols associated with the topic of vision, including symbols representing text size, magnification, VoiceOver, and spoken dialogue.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/bedd6018a62492eff46566493335ebe7/accessibility-vision-section-hero%402x.png)

The people who use your interface may be blind, color blind, or have low vision or light sensitivity. They may also be in situations where lighting conditions and screen brightness affect their ability to interact with your interface.

**Support larger text sizes.** Make sure people can adjust the size of your text or icons to make them more legible, visible, and comfortable to read. Ideally, give people the option to enlarge text by at least 200 percent (or 140 percent in watchOS apps). Your interface can support font size enlargement either through custom UI, or by adopting Dynamic Type. Dynamic Type is a systemwide setting that lets people adjust the size of text for comfort and legibility. For more guidance, see [Supporting Dynamic Type](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography#Supporting-Dynamic-Type).

**Use recommended defaults for custom type sizes.** Each platform has different default and minimum sizes for system-defined type styles to promote readability. If you’re using custom type styles, follow the recommended defaults.

| Platform | Default size | Minimum size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS, iPadOS | 17 pt | 11 pt |
| macOS | 13 pt | 10 pt |
| tvOS | 29 pt | 23 pt |
| visionOS | 17 pt | 12 pt |
| watchOS | 16 pt | 12 pt |

**Bear in mind that font weight can also impact how easy text is to read.** If you’re using a custom font with a thin weight, aim for larger than the recommended sizes to increase legibility. For more guidance, see [Typography](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography).

![An illustration of a rectangular view containing the word 'Hello,' formatted bold, at a small font size.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/b8366a96b31af036b2414243d299b011/accessibility-font-weight-small-bold%402x.png)Thicker weights are easier to read for smaller font sizes.

![An illustration of a rectangular view containing the word 'Hello,' formatted thin, at a large font size.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/1f164f6ff2cb994f3852340272a3df90/accessibility-font-weight-large-thin%402x.png)Consider increasing the font size when using a thin weight.

**Strive to meet color contrast minimum standards.** To ensure all information in your app is legible, it’s important that there’s enough contrast between foreground text and icons and background colors. Two popular standards of measure for color contrast are the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) and the Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA). Use standard contrast calculators to ensure your UI meets acceptable levels. [Accessibility Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility/accessibility-inspector) uses the following values from WCAG Level AA as guidance in determining whether your app’s colors have an acceptable contrast.

| Text size | Text weight | Minimum contrast ratio |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Up to 17 pts | All | 4.5:1 |
| 18 pts | All | 3:1 |
| All | Bold | 3:1 |

If your app doesn’t provide this minimum contrast by default, ensure it at least provides a higher contrast color scheme when the system setting Increase Contrast is turned on. If your app supports [Dark Mode](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode), make sure to check the minimum contrast in both light and dark appearances.

![An illustration of a button that has insufficient contrast between the button's title and background.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/7da7a46683e0b9063fb1c9db6ab59bd9/accessibilty-button-poor-color-contrast%402x.png)A button with insufficient color contrast

![An X in a circle to indicate incorrect usage.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/209f6f0fc8ad99d9bf59e12d82d06584/crossout%402x.png)

![An illustration of a button that has sufficient contrast between the button's title and background.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/7e5df7edfe62df057eef743f9a449040/accessibilty-button-good-color-contrast%402x.png)A button with sufficient color contrast

![A checkmark in a circle to indicate correct usage.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/88662da92338267bb64cd2275c84e484/checkmark%402x.png)

**Prefer system-defined colors.** These colors have their own accessible variants that automatically adapt when people adjust their color preferences, such as enabling Increase Contrast or toggling between the light and dark appearances. For guidance, see [Color](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color).

![An illustration demonstrating how the system-defined color red appears above a light and dark background. In the illustration, a circle is positioned above a rounded rectangle. The left side of the rounded rectangle is light in color, and the right side is dark. The left side of the circle is slightly darker than the right side.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/9fec337c567366d81319e2daf38b6a8a/accessibility-system-red-ios-default%402x.png)The `systemRed` default color in iOS

In the illustration, a circle is positioned above a rounded rectangle. The left side of the rounded rectangle is light in color, and the right side is dark. The left side of the circle is considerably darker than the right side.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/9e1e71f5dff34acee2faaff88ac135a0/accessibility-system-red-ios-accessible%402x.png)The `systemRed` accessible color in iOS

**Convey information with more than color alone.** Some people have trouble differentiating between certain colors and shades. For example, people who are color blind may have particular difficulty with pairings such as red-green and blue-orange. Offer visual indicators, like distinct shapes or icons, in addition to color to help people perceive differences in function and changes in state. Consider allowing people to customize color schemes such as chart colors or game characters so they can personalize your interface in a way that’s comfortable for them.

![An illustration of a green circle to the left of a red circle.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5d62d6f6c6ff1563d80847b3b29e2125/accessibility-differentiate-with-shapes-incorrect%402x.png)For someone with red-green color blindness, these indicators might appear the same.

![An X in a circle to indicate incorrect usage.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/209f6f0fc8ad99d9bf59e12d82d06584/crossout%402x.png)

![An illustration of a green circle containing a checkmark to the left of a red octagon containing an X.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/e13c9c34a780c2d2ab0e614f55a3e73e/accessibility-differentiate-with-shapes-correct%402x.png)Both visual indicators and color help differentiate between indicators.

![A checkmark in a circle to indicate correct usage.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/88662da92338267bb64cd2275c84e484/checkmark%402x.png)

**Describe your app’s interface and content for VoiceOver.** VoiceOver is a screen reader that lets people experience your app’s interface without needing to see the screen. For more guidance, see [VoiceOver](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/voiceover).

## [Hearing](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility\#Hearing)

![An illustration containing five symbols associated with the topic of hearing, including symbols representing sound, waveforms, and closed captioning.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/eef3040be22f7aa6b10dc45b2918f9f8/accessibility-hearing-section-hero%402x.png)

The people who use your interface may be deaf or hard of hearing. They may also be in noisy or public environments.

**Support text-based ways to enjoy audio and video.** It’s important that dialogue and crucial information about your app or game isn’t communicated through audio alone. Depending on the context, give people different text-based ways to experience their media, and allow people to customize the visual presentation of that text:

- **Captions** give people the textual equivalent of audible information in video or audio-only content. Captions are great for scenarios like game cutscenes and video clips where text synchronizes live with the media.

- **Subtitles** allow people to read live onscreen dialogue in their preferred language. Subtitles are great for TV shows and movies.

- **Audio descriptions** are interspersed between natural pauses in the main audio of a video and supply spoken narration of important information that’s presented only visually.

- **Transcripts** provide a complete textual description of a video, covering both audible and visual information. Transcripts are great for longer-form media like podcasts and audiobooks where people may want to review content as a whole or highlight the transcript as media is playing.

For developer guidance, see [Selecting subtitles and alternative audio tracks](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFoundation/selecting-subtitles-and-alternative-audio-tracks).

**Use haptics in addition to audio cues.** If your interface conveys information through audio cues — such as a success chime, error sound, or game feedback — consider pairing that sound with matching haptics for people who can’t perceive the audio or have their audio turned off. In iOS and iPadOS, you can also use [Music Haptics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MediaAccessibility/music-haptics) and [Audio graphs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility/audio-graphs) to let people experience music and infographics through vibration and texture. For guidance, see [Playing haptics](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics).

![An illustration of an iPhone device vibrating as music plays from the device.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/1bf9d6ae5c3586a5163ce6abf0cabb95/accessibility-haptic-audio-combo%402x.png)

**Augment audio cues with visual cues.** This is especially important for games and spatial apps where important content might be taking place off screen. When using audio to guide people towards a specific action, also add in visual indicators that point to where you want people to interact.

## [Mobility](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility\#Mobility)

![An illustration containing five symbols associated with the topic of mobility, including symbols representing the keyboard, movement, and touch.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/f8e9d74dc994111ba0ee7fa436fc2fc1/accessibility-mobility-section-hero%402x.png)

Ensure your interface offers a comfortable experience for people with limited dexterity or mobility.

**Offer sufficiently sized controls.** Controls that are too small are hard for many people to interact with and select. Strive to meet the recommended minimum control size for each platform to ensure controls and menus are comfortable for all when tapping and clicking.

| Platform | Default control size | Minimum control size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS, iPadOS | 44x44 pt | 28x28 pt |
| macOS | 28x28 pt | 20x20 pt |
| tvOS | 66x66 pt | 56x56 pt |
| visionOS | 60x60 pt | 28x28 pt |
| watchOS | 44x44 pt | 28x28 pt |

**Consider spacing between controls as important as size.** Include enough padding between elements to reduce the chance that someone taps the wrong control. In general, it works well to add about 12 points of padding around elements that include a bezel. For elements without a bezel, about 24 points of padding works well around the element’s visible edges.

![An illustration showing three buttons: rewind, play, and fast forward. The buttons have insufficient padding between them.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/4148fe218b3f50b66d64eeda288de5be/accessibility-controls-spacing-incorrect%402x.png)Elements with insufficient padding

![An X in a circle to indicate incorrect usage.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/209f6f0fc8ad99d9bf59e12d82d06584/crossout%402x.png)

![An illustration showing three buttons: rewind, play, and fast forward. The buttons are spaced apart, with sufficient padding between them.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/98bc500a0a2cf15620b972de1fcce3b3/accessibility-controls-spacing-correct%402x.png)Elements with sufficient padding

![A checkmark in a circle to indicate correct usage.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/88662da92338267bb64cd2275c84e484/checkmark%402x.png)

**Support simple gestures for common interactions.** For many people, with or without disabilities, complex gestures can be challenging. For interactions people do frequently in your app or game, use the simplest gesture possible — avoid custom multifinger and multihand gestures — so repetitive actions are both comfortable and easy to remember.

**Offer alternatives to gestures.** Make sure your UI’s core functionality is accessible through more than one type of physical interaction. Gestures can be less comfortable for people who have limited dexterity, so offer onscreen ways to achieve the same outcome. For example, if you use a swipe gesture to dismiss a view, also make a button available so people can tap or use an assistive device.

![An illustration of a table view in edit mode. The rows of the table include delete buttons.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/fa893cee3fa5c70e99dfefa85c0c390a/accessibility-tap-to-delete%402x.png)Edit and tap to delete

![An illustration of a table view. One of the rows in the table is swiped to the left to reveal a delete button.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/f6eb08c3c3a75f5b1b337b4813b4e95e/accessibility-swipe-to-delete%402x.png)Swipe to delete

**Let people use Voice Control to give guidance and enter information verbally.** With Voice Control, people can interact with their devices entirely by speaking commands. They can perform gestures, interact with screen elements, dictate and edit text, and more. To ensure a smooth experience, label interface elements appropriately. For developer guidance, see [Voice Control](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility/voice-control).

**Integrate with Siri and Shortcuts to let people perform tasks using voice alone.** When your app supports Siri and Shortcuts, people can automate the important and repetitive tasks they perform regularly. They can initiate these tasks from Siri, the Action button on their iPhone or Apple Watch, and shortcuts on their Home Screen or in Control Center. For guidance, see [Siri](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/siri).

**Support mobility-related assistive technologies.** Features like [VoiceOver](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/voiceover), AssistiveTouch, Full Keyboard Access, Pointer Control, and [Switch Control](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility/switch-control) offer alternative ways for people with low mobility to interact with their devices. Conduct testing and verify that your app or game supports these technologies, and that your interface elements are appropriately labeled to ensure a great experience. For more information, see [Performing accessibility testing for your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility/performing-accessibility-testing-for-your-app).

## [Speech](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility\#Speech)

![An illustration containing five symbols associated with the topic of speech, including symbols representing waveforms and speech.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/62f06a887d774ec29a27ce2be6d30444/accessibility-speech-section-hero%402x.png)

Apple’s accessibility features help people with speech disabilities and people who prefer text-based interactions to communicate effectively using their devices.

**Let people use the keyboard alone to navigate and interact with your app.** People can turn on Full Keyboard Access to navigate apps using their physical keyboard. The system also defines accessibility keyboard shortcuts and a wide range of other [keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102650) that many people use all the time. Avoid overriding system-defined keyboard shortcuts and evaluate your app to ensure it works well with Full Keyboard Access. For additional guidance, see [Keyboards](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/keyboards). For developer guidance, see [Support Full Keyboard Access in your iOS app](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10120).

**Support Switch Control.** Switch Control is an assistive technology that lets people control their devices through separate hardware, game controllers, or sounds such as a click or a pop. People can perform actions like selecting, tapping, typing, and drawing when your app or game supports the ability to navigate using Switch Control. For developer guidance, see [Switch Control](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility/switch-control).

## [Cognitive](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility\#Cognitive)

![An illustration containing five symbols associated with the topic of cognition, including symbols representing music, security, and information hierarchy.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/0d837305d3c06f6ba0199cf2764df3fd/accessibility-cognitive-section-hero%402x.png)

When you minimize complexity in your app or game, all people benefit.

**Keep actions simple and intuitive.** Ensure that people can navigate your interface using easy-to-remember and consistent interactions. Prefer system gestures and behaviors people are already familiar with over creating custom gestures people must learn and retain.

**Minimize use of time-boxed interface elements.** Views and controls that auto-dismiss on a timer can be problematic for people who need longer to process information, and for people who use assistive technologies that require more time to traverse the interface. Prefer dismissing views with an explicit action.

**Consider offering difficulty accommodations in games.** Everyone has their own way of playing and enjoying games. To support a variety of cognitive abilities, consider adding the ability to customize the difficulty level of your game, such as offering options for people to reduce the criteria for successfully completing a level, adjust reaction time, or enable control assistance.

**Let people control audio and video playback.** Avoid autoplaying audio and video content without also providing controls to start and stop it. Make sure these controls are discoverable and easy to act upon, and consider global settings that let people opt out of auto-playing all audio and video. For developer guidance, see [Animated images](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility/animated-images) and [`isVideoAutoplayEnabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIAccessibility/isVideoAutoplayEnabled).

**Allow people to opt out of flashing lights in video playback.** People might want to avoid bright, frequent flashes of light in the media they consume. A Dim Flashing Lights setting allows the system to calculate, mitigate, and inform people about flashing lights in a piece of media. If your app supports video playback, ensure that it responds appropriately to the Dim Flashing Lights setting. For developer guidance, see [Flashing lights](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MediaAccessibility/flashing-lights).

**Be cautious with fast-moving and blinking animations.** When you use these effects in excess, it can be distracting, cause dizziness, and in some cases even result in epileptic episodes. People who are prone to these effects can turn on the Reduce Motion accessibility setting. When this setting is active, ensure your app or game responds by reducing automatic and repetitive animations, including zooming, scaling, and peripheral motion. Other best practices for reducing motion include:

- Tightening animation springs to reduce bounce effects

- Tracking animations directly with people’s gestures

- Avoiding animating depth changes in z-axis layers

- Replacing transitions in x-, y-, and z-axes with fades to avoid motion

- Avoiding animating into and out of blurs

**Optimize your app’s UI for Assistive Access.** Assistive Access is an accessibility feature in iOS and iPadOS that allows people with cognitive disabilities to use a streamlined version of your app. Assistive Access sets a default layout and control presentation for apps that reduces cognitive load, such as the following layout of the Camera app.

![A screenshot of the Camera app in Assistive Access, showing an interface with three large buttons: Photo, Video, and Back.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/186637e83d4ec29d3d20a8249be8a538/accessibility-assistive-access-camera%402x.png)

![A screenshot of the Camera app open to the photo screen in Assistive Access, showing an interface with two large buttons: Take Photo and Back.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/c2abc07058fc2e64295271c85c5d66eb/accessibility-assistive-access-camera-photo-mode%402x.png)

To optimize your app for this mode, use the following guidelines when Assistive Access is turned on:

- Identify the core functionality of your app and consider removing noncritical workflows and UI elements.

- Break up multistep workflows so people can focus on a single interaction per screen.

- Always ask for confirmation twice whenever people perform an action that’s difficult to recover from, such a deleting a file.

For developer guidance, see [Assistive Access](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility/assistive-access).

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility\#Platform-considerations)

_No additional considerations for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, or watchOS._

### [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility\#visionOS)

visionOS offers a variety of accessibility features people can use to interact with their surroundings in ways that are comfortable and work best for them, including head and hand Pointer Control, and a Zoom feature.

Video with custom controls.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: A recording of someone using Pointer Control to interact with content in an app's visionOS window. The person isn't visible in the recording. Only the pointer is visible. It's centered in the field of view, and the person uses their head movement to position content beneath the pointer.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility#)

![A screenshot of an app's window in visionOS. A zoom lens is visible above a portion of the window, and displays a zoomed-in version of the content beneath the lens.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/087dd22d68c54c95cd70008020f6dc1e/visionos-accessibility-zoom-lens%402x.png)

**Prioritize comfort.** The immersive nature of visionOS means that interfaces, animations, and interactions have a greater chance of causing motion sickness, and visual and ergonomic discomfort for people. To ensure the most comfortable experience, consider these tips:

- Keep interface elements within a person’s field of view. Prefer horizontal layouts to vertical ones that might cause neck strain, and avoid demanding the viewer’s attention in different locations in quick succession.

- Reduce the speed and intensity of animated objects, particularly in someone’s peripheral vision.

- Be gentle with camera and video motion, and avoid situations where someone may feel like the world around them is moving without their control.

- Avoid anchoring content to the wearer’s head, which may make them feel stuck and confined, and also prevent them from using assistive technologies like Pointer Control.

- Minimize the need for large and repetitive gestures, as these can become tiresome and may be difficult depending on a person’s surroundings.

For additional guidance, see [Create accessible spatial experiences](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10034) and [Design considerations for vision and motion](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10078).

# Color

Judicious use of color can enhance communication, evoke your brand, provide visual continuity, communicate status and feedback, and help people understand information.

![A sketch of a paint palette, suggesting the use of color. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/10ec5551985c77cabaeaaaff016cdfd8/foundations-color-intro%402x.png)

The system defines colors that look good on various backgrounds and appearance modes, and can automatically adapt to vibrancy and accessibility settings. Using system colors is a convenient way to make your experience feel at home on the device.

You may also want to use custom colors to enhance the visual experience of your app or game and express its unique personality. The following guidelines can help you use color in ways that people appreciate, regardless of whether you use system-defined or custom colors.

## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color\#Best-practices)

**Avoid using the same color to mean different things.** Use color consistently throughout your interface, especially when you use it to help communicate information like status or interactivity. For example, if you use your brand color to indicate that a borderless button is interactive, using the same or similar color to stylize noninteractive text is confusing.

**Make sure all your app’s colors work well in light, dark, and increased contrast contexts.** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS offer both light and [dark](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode) appearance settings. [System colors](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color#System-colors) vary subtly depending on the system appearance, adjusting to ensure proper color differentiation and contrast for text, symbols, and other elements. With the Increase Contrast setting turned on, the color differences become far more apparent. When possible, use system colors, which already define variants for all these contexts. If you define a custom color, make sure to supply light and dark variants, and an increased contrast option for each variant that provides a significantly higher amount of visual differentiation. Even if your app ships in a single appearance mode, provide both light and dark colors to support Liquid Glass adaptivity in these contexts.

![A screenshot of the Notes app in iOS with the light system appearance and default contrast. The Notes app is open to a note with the text 'Note'. The text is selected, which shows a yellow selection highlight and text editing menu. The Done button appears in the upper-right corner. The Liquid Glass background of the button is yellow, and its label, which shows a checkmark, is white. The shade of yellow is vibrant.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/033f3f6540cc36385bc5993e2152895b/color-context-light-mode%402x.png)

The text is selected, which shows a yellow selection highlight and text editing menu. The Done button appears in the upper-right corner. The Liquid Glass background of the button is yellow, and its label, which shows a checkmark, is black.

Increased contrast (dark)

**Test your app’s color scheme under a variety of lighting conditions.** Colors can look different when you view your app outside on a sunny day or in dim light. In bright surroundings, colors look darker and more muted. In dark environments, colors appear bright and saturated. In visionOS, colors can look different depending on the colors of a wall or object in a person’s physical surroundings and how it reflects light. Adjust app colors to provide an optimal viewing experience in the majority of use cases.

**Test your app on different devices.** For example, the True Tone display — available on certain iPhone, iPad, and Mac models — uses ambient light sensors to automatically adjust the white point of the display to adapt to the lighting conditions of the current environment. Apps that primarily support reading, photos, video, and gaming can strengthen or weaken this effect by specifying a white point adaptivity style (for developer guidance, see [`UIWhitePointAdaptivityStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/UIWhitePointAdaptivityStyle)). Test tvOS apps on multiple brands of HD and 4K TVs, and with different display settings. You can also test the appearance of your app using different color profiles on a Mac — such as P3 and Standard RGB (sRGB) — by choosing a profile in System Settings > Displays. For guidance, see [Color management](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color#Color-management).

**Consider how artwork and translucency affect nearby colors.** Variations in artwork sometimes warrant changes to nearby colors to maintain visual continuity and prevent interface elements from becoming overpowering or underwhelming. Maps, for example, displays a light color scheme when in map mode but switches to a dark color scheme when in satellite mode. Colors can also appear different when placed behind or applied to a translucent element like a toolbar.

**If your app lets people choose colors, prefer system-provided color controls where available.** Using built-in color pickers provides a consistent user experience, in addition to letting people save a set of colors they can access from any app. For developer guidance, see [`ColorPicker`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ColorPicker).

## [Inclusive color](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color\#Inclusive-color)

**Avoid relying solely on color to differentiate between objects, indicate interactivity, or communicate essential information.** When you use color to convey information, be sure to provide the same information in alternative ways so people with color blindness or other visual disabilities can understand it. For example, you can use text labels or glyph shapes to identify objects or states.

**Avoid using colors that make it hard to perceive content in your app.** For example, insufficient contrast can cause icons and text to blend with the background and make content hard to read, and people who are color blind might not be able to distinguish some color combinations. For guidance, see [Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility).

**Consider how the colors you use might be perceived in other countries and cultures.** For example, red communicates danger in some cultures, but has positive connotations in other cultures. Make sure the colors in your app send the message you intend.

## [System colors](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color\#System-colors)

**Avoid hard-coding system color values in your app.** Documented color values are for your reference during the app design process. The actual color values may fluctuate from release to release, based on a variety of environmental variables. Use APIs like [`Color`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Color) to apply system colors.

iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS also define sets of _dynamic system colors_ that match the color schemes of standard UI components and automatically adapt to both light and dark contexts. Each dynamic color is semantically defined by its purpose, rather than its appearance or color values. For example, some colors represent view backgrounds at different levels of hierarchy and other colors represent foreground content, such as labels, links, and separators.

**Avoid redefining the semantic meanings of dynamic system colors.** To ensure a consistent experience and ensure your interface looks great when the appearance of the platform changes, use dynamic system colors as intended. For example, don’t use the [separator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor/separator) color as a text color, or [secondary text label](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor/secondarylabel) color as a background color.

## [Liquid Glass color](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color\#Liquid-Glass-color)

By default, [Liquid Glass](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials#Liquid-Glass) has no inherent color, and instead takes on colors from the content directly behind it. You can apply color to some Liquid Glass elements, giving them the appearance of colored or stained glass. This is useful for drawing emphasis to a specific control, like a primary call to action, and is the approach the system uses for prominent button styling. Symbols or text labels on Liquid Glass controls can also have color.

![A screenshot of the Done button in iOS, which appears as a checkmark on a blue Liquid Glass background.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/df4d0a0bca32edb16d7ff86e34d6fe2d/color-liquid-glass-overview-tinted%402x.png)Controls can use color in the Liquid Glass background, like in a primary action button.

![A screenshot of a tab bar in iOS, with the first tab selected. The symbol and text label of the selected tab bar item are blue.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5a9078b2ea4baec1f15773638c9377c6/color-liquid-glass-overview-color-over-tab-bar%402x.png)Symbols and text that appear on Liquid Glass can have color, like in a selected tab bar item.

![A screenshot of the Share button in iOS over a colorful image. The colors from the background image infuse the Liquid Glass in the button, affecting its color.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/9cf610d972c97dee46b9e206525b2ae7/color-liquid-glass-overview-clear%402x.png)By default, Liquid Glass picks up the color from the content layer behind it.

For smaller elements like toolbars and tab bars, the system can adapt Liquid Glass between a light and dark appearance in response to the underlying content. By default, symbols and text on these elements follow a monochromatic color scheme, becoming darker when the underlying content is light, and lighter when it’s dark. Liquid Glass appears more opaque in larger elements like sidebars to preserve legibility over complex backgrounds and accommodate richer content on the material’s surface.

**Apply color sparingly to the Liquid Glass material, and to symbols or text on the material.** If you apply color, reserve it for elements that truly benefit from emphasis, such as status indicators or primary actions. To emphasize primary actions, apply color to the background rather than to symbols or text. For example, the system applies the app accent color to the background in prominent buttons — such as the Done button — to draw attention and elevate their visual prominence. Refrain from adding color to the background of multiple controls.

![A screenshot of the top half of an iPhone app that shows a toolbar with several buttons. All of the buttons in the toolbar use a blue accent color for their Liquid Glass background.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/9b7b9adb67ee5f70839540534fdeb374/colors-liquid-glass-usage-incorrect%402x.png)

**Avoid using similar colors in control labels if your app has a colorful background.** While color can make apps more visually appealing, playful, or reflective of your brand, too much color can be overwhelming and make control labels more difficult to read. If your app features colorful backgrounds or visually rich content, prefer a monochromatic appearance for toolbars and tab bars, or choose an accent color with sufficient visual differentiation. By contrast, in apps with primarily monochromatic content or backgrounds, choosing your brand color as the app accent color can be an effective way to tailor your app experience and reflect your company’s identity.

**Be aware of the placement of color in the content layer.** Make sure your interface maintains sufficient contrast by avoiding overlap of similar colors in the content layer and controls when possible. Although colorful content might intermittently scroll underneath controls, make sure its default or resting state — like the top of a screen of scrollable content — maintains clear legibility.

## [Color management](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color\#Color-management)

A _color space_ represents the colors in a _color model_ like RGB or CMYK. Common color spaces — sometimes called _gamuts_ — are sRGB and Display P3.

![Diagram showing the colors included in the sRGB space, compared to the larger number of colors included in the P3 color space.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/c10d0ec4c78a6b824552058caac031b5/color-graphic-wide-color%402x.png)

A _color profile_ describes the colors in a color space using, for example, mathematical formulas or tables of data that map colors to numerical representations. An image embeds its color profile so that a device can interpret the image’s colors correctly and reproduce them on a display.

**Apply color profiles to your images.** Color profiles help ensure that your app’s colors appear as intended on different displays. The sRGB color space produces accurate colors on most displays.

**Use wide color to enhance the visual experience on compatible displays.** Wide color displays support a P3 color space, which can produce richer, more saturated colors than sRGB. As a result, photos and videos that use wide color are more lifelike, and visual data and status indicators that use wide color can be more meaningful. When appropriate, use the Display P3 color profile at 16 bits per pixel (per channel) and export images in PNG format. Note that you need to use a wide color display to design wide color images and select P3 colors.

**Provide color space–specific image and color variations if necessary.** In general, P3 colors and images appear fine on sRGB displays. Occasionally, it may be hard to distinguish two very similar P3 colors when viewing them on an sRGB display. Gradients that use P3 colors can also sometimes appear clipped on sRGB displays. To avoid these issues and to ensure visual fidelity on both wide color and sRGB displays, you can use the asset catalog of your Xcode project to provide different versions of images and colors for each color space.

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color\#Platform-considerations)

### [iOS, iPadOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color\#iOS-iPadOS)

iOS defines two sets of dynamic background colors — _system_ and _grouped_ — each of which contains primary, secondary, and tertiary variants that help you convey a hierarchy of information. In general, use the grouped background colors ( [`systemGroupedBackground`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/systemGroupedBackground), [`secondarySystemGroupedBackground`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/secondarySystemGroupedBackground), and [`tertiarySystemGroupedBackground`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/tertiarySystemGroupedBackground)) when you have a grouped table view; otherwise, use the system set of background colors ( [`systemBackground`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/systemBackground), [`secondarySystemBackground`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/secondarySystemBackground), and [`tertiarySystemBackground`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/tertiarySystemBackground)).

With both sets of background colors, you generally use the variants to indicate hierarchy in the following ways:

- Primary for the overall view

- Secondary for grouping content or elements within the overall view

- Tertiary for grouping content or elements within secondary elements

For foreground content, iOS defines the following dynamic colors:

| Color | Use for… | UIKit API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Label | A text label that contains primary content. | [`label`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/label) |
| Secondary label | A text label that contains secondary content. | [`secondaryLabel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/secondaryLabel) |
| Tertiary label | A text label that contains tertiary content. | [`tertiaryLabel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/tertiaryLabel) |
| Quaternary label | A text label that contains quaternary content. | [`quaternaryLabel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/quaternaryLabel) |

| Opaque separator | A separator that doesn’t allow any underlying content to be visible. | [`opaqueSeparator`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/opaqueSeparator) |
| Link | Text that functions as a link. | [`link`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/link) |

### [macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color\#macOS)

macOS defines the following dynamic system colors (you can also view them in the Developer palette of the standard Color panel):

| Color | Use for… | AppKit API |
| --- | --- | --- |

#### [App accent colors](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color\#App-accent-colors)

Beginning in macOS 11, you can specify an _accent color_ to customize the appearance of your app’s buttons, selection highlighting, and sidebar icons. The system applies your accent color when the current value in General > Accent color settings is _multicolor_.

![A screenshot of the accent color picker in the System Settings app.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/93ebe4b08af4e94a5c4479459fc7905b/colors-accent-colors-picker-multicolor%402x.png)

If people set their accent color setting to a value other than multicolor, the system applies their chosen color to the relevant items throughout your app, replacing your accent color. The exception is a sidebar icon that uses a fixed color you specify. Because a fixed-color sidebar icon uses a specific color to provide meaning, the system doesn’t override its color when people change the value of accent color settings. For guidance, see [Sidebars](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sidebars).

### [tvOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color\#tvOS)

**Consider choosing a limited color palette that coordinates with your app logo.** Subtle use of color can help you communicate your brand while deferring to the content.

**Avoid using only color to indicate focus.** Subtle scaling and responsive animation are the primary ways to denote interactivity when an element is in focus.

### [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color\#visionOS)

**Use color sparingly, especially on glass.** Standard visionOS windows typically use the system-defined glass [material](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials), which lets light and objects from people’s physical surroundings and their space show through. Because the colors in these physical and virtual objects are visible through the glass, they can affect the legibility of colorful app content in the window. Prefer using color in places where it can help call attention to important information or show the relationship between parts of the interface.

**Prefer using color in bold text and large areas.** Color in lightweight text or small areas can make them harder to see and understand.

**In a fully immersive experience, help people maintain visual comfort by keeping brightness levels balanced.** Although using high contrast can help direct people’s attention to important content, it can also cause visual discomfort if people’s eyes have adjusted to low light or darkness. Consider making content fully bright only when the rest of the visual context is also bright. For example, avoid displaying a bright object on a very dark or black background, especially if the object flashes or moves.

### [watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color\#watchOS)

**Use background color to support existing content or supply additional information.** Background color can establish a sense of place and help people recognize key content. For example, in Activity, each infographic view for the Move, Exercise, and Stand Activity rings has a background that matches the color of the ring. Use background color when you have something to communicate, rather than as a solely visual flourish. Avoid using full-screen background color in views that are likely to remain onscreen for long periods of time, such as in a workout or audio-playing app.

**Recognize that people might prefer graphic complications to use tinted mode instead of full color.** The system can use a single color that’s based on the wearer’s selected color in a graphic complication’s images, gauges, and text. For guidance, see [Complications](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/complications).

# Dark Mode

Dark Mode is a systemwide appearance setting that uses a dark color palette to provide a comfortable viewing experience tailored for low-light environments.

![A sketch of concentric circles with half-filled areas, suggesting the presence of light and dark. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/f354bd96f1890df83e7f8e31835f80bc/foundations-dark-mode-intro%402x.png)

In iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS, people often choose Dark Mode as their default interface style, and they generally expect all apps and games to respect their preference. In Dark Mode, the system uses a dark color palette for all screens, views, menus, and controls, and may also use greater perceptual contrast to make foreground content stand out against the darker backgrounds.

## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode\#Best-practices)

**Avoid offering an app-specific appearance setting.** An app-specific appearance mode option creates more work for people because they have to adjust more than one setting to get the appearance they want. Worse, they may think your app is broken because it doesn’t respond to their systemwide appearance choice.

**Ensure that your app looks good in both appearance modes.** In addition to using one mode or the other, people can choose the Auto appearance setting, which switches between the light and dark appearances as conditions change throughout the day, potentially while your app is running.

**Test your content to make sure that it remains comfortably legible in both appearance modes.** For example, in Dark Mode with Increase Contrast and Reduce Transparency turned on (both separately and together), you may find places where dark text is less legible when it’s on a dark background. You might also find that turning on Increase Contrast in Dark Mode can result in reduced visual contrast between dark text and a dark background. Although people with strong vision might still be able to read lower contrast text, such text could be illegible for many. For guidance, see [Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility).

**In rare cases, consider using only a dark appearance in the interface.** For example, it can make sense for an app that supports immersive media viewing to use a permanently dark appearance that lets the UI recede and helps people focus on the media.

![A screenshot of the Stocks app on iPhone in its standard dark-only appearance, showing the Apple Inc. stock in detail. The view includes a summary of the current stock price along with a graph of its performance over the past year.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/50e3d01e38e69e84976f7a1747321ba8/dark-mode-stocks-app-dark-only-mode%402x.png)

The Stocks app uses a dark-only appearance

## [Dark Mode colors](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode\#Dark-Mode-colors)

The color palette in Dark Mode includes dimmer background colors and brighter foreground colors. It’s important to realize that these colors aren’t necessarily inversions of their light counterparts: while many colors are inverted, some are not. For more information, see [Specifications](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color#Specifications).

**Embrace colors that adapt to the current appearance.** Semantic colors (like [`labelColor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSColor/labelColor) and [`controlColor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSColor/controlColor) in macOS or [`separator`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor/separator) in iOS and iPadOS) automatically adapt to the current appearance. When you need a custom color, add a Color Set asset to your app’s asset catalog in Xcode, and specify the bright and dim variants of the color. Avoid using hard-coded color values or colors that don’t adapt.

![An illustration of a square with a light background and four color swatches representing system colors in the light appearance.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/083d8f0f70c26b7fdea230f7da1edfeb/dark-mode-system-colors-light%402x.png)System colors in the light appearance

![An illustration of a square with a dark background and four color swatches representing system colors in the dark appearance.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/247df4f7b00e65cdd3827de84135fcda/dark-mode-system-colors-dark%402x.png)System colors in the dark appearance

**Aim for sufficient color contrast in all appearances.** Using system-defined colors can help you achieve a good contrast ratio between your foreground and background content. At a minimum, make sure the contrast ratio between colors is no lower than 4.5:1. For custom foreground and background colors, strive for a contrast ratio of 7:1, especially in small text. This ratio ensures that your foreground content stands out from the background, and helps your content meet recommended accessibility guidelines.

**Soften the color of white backgrounds.** If you display a content image that includes a white background, consider slightly darkening the image to prevent the background from glowing in the surrounding Dark Mode context.

### [Icons and images](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode\#Icons-and-images)

The system uses [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols) (which automatically adapt to Dark Mode) and full-color images that are optimized for both the light and dark appearances.

**Use SF Symbols wherever possible.** Symbols work well in both appearance modes when you use dynamic colors to tint them or when you add vibrancy. For guidance, see [Color](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color).

**Design separate interface icons for the light and dark appearances if necessary.** For example, an icon that depicts a full moon might need a subtle dark outline to contrast well with a light background, but need no outline when it displays on a dark background. Similarly, an icon that represents a drop of oil might need a slight border to make the edge visible against a dark background.

![An illustration of a black droplet icon against a light background.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5377a16f9c47c32d5716a2de9e7e5ddb/dark-mode-icon-in-light-mode%402x.png)Icon in the light appearance with no border

![An illustration of a black droplet icon against a dark background.

**Make sure full-color images and icons look good in both appearances.** Use the same asset if it looks good in both the light and dark appearances. If an asset looks good in only one mode, modify the asset or create separate light and dark assets. Use asset catalogs to combine your assets into a single named image.

### [Text](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode\#Text)

The system uses vibrancy and increased contrast to maintain the legibility of text on darker backgrounds.

**Use the system-provided label colors for labels.** The primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary label colors adapt automatically to the light and dark appearances.

![An illustration of a button in the light appearance with dark primary label text.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/4dc33e45cd6cae3da766f885044174e9/dark-mode-label-in-light-mode%402x.png)Primary label in the light appearance

![An illustration of a button in the dark appearance with light secondary label text.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5a2df784b29a55d1db485c30efb94009/dark-mode-label-in-dark-mode%402x.png)Secondary label in the dark appearance

**Use system views to draw text fields and text views.** System views and controls make your app’s text look good on all backgrounds, adjusting automatically for the presence or absence of vibrancy. When possible, use a system-provided view to display text instead of drawing the text yourself.

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode\#Platform-considerations)

_No additional considerations for tvOS. Dark Mode isn’t supported in visionOS or watchOS._

### [iOS, iPadOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode\#iOS-iPadOS)

In Dark Mode, the system uses two sets of background colors — called _base_ and _elevated_ — to enhance the perception of depth when one dark interface is layered above another. The base colors are dimmer, making background interfaces appear to recede, and the elevated colors are brighter, making foreground interfaces appear to advance.

![A diagram that shows a stack of 4 terms on top of a black background. The term at the top shows the most contrast with the background and the term at the bottom shows the least.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/0d71ac9f5186541dce35b5f702311bd0/base-with-four-semantic-colors%402x.png)Base

![A diagram that shows a stack of 4 terms on top of a nearly black background. The term at the top shows the most contrast with the background and the term at the bottom shows the least.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/0dacc182adc819b08eb8cdcc897b08a4/elevated-with-four-semantic-colors%402x.png)Elevated

![A diagram that shows a stack of 4 terms on top of a white background. The term at the top shows the most contrast with the background and the term at the bottom shows the least.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/cbbe9a39049fd3d3d2122876de64d207/light-with-four-semantic-colors%402x.png)Light

**Prefer the system background colors.** Dark Mode is dynamic, which means that the background color automatically changes from base to elevated when an interface is in the foreground, such as a popover or modal sheet. The system also uses the elevated background color to provide visual separation between apps in a multitasking environment and between windows in a multiple-window context. Using a custom background color can make it harder for people to perceive these system-provided visual distinctions.

### [macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode\#macOS)

When people choose the graphite accent color in General settings, macOS causes window backgrounds to pick up color from the current desktop picture. The result — called _desktop tinting_ — is a subtle effect that helps windows blend more harmoniously with their surrounding content.

**Include some transparency in custom component backgrounds when appropriate.** Transparency lets your components pick up color from the window background when desktop tinting is active, creating a visual harmony that can persist even when the desktop picture changes. To help achieve this harmony, add transparency only to a custom component that has a visible background or bezel, and only when the component is in a neutral state, such as state that doesn’t use color. You don’t want to add transparency when the component is in a state that uses color, because doing so can cause the component’s color to fluctuate when the window background adjusts to a different location on the desktop or when the desktop picture changes.

# Typography

Your typographic choices can help you display legible text, convey an information hierarchy, communicate important content, and express your brand or style.

![A sketch of a small letter A to the left of a large letter A, suggesting the use of typography to convey hierarchical information. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/d90940d120149af7220e4fedfd1c10bd/foundations-typography-intro%402x.png)

## [Ensuring legibility](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography\#Ensuring-legibility)

**Use font sizes that most people can read easily.** People need to be able to read your content at various viewing distances and under a variety of conditions. Follow the recommended default and minimum text sizes for each platform — for both custom and system fonts — to ensure your text is legible on all devices. Keep in mind that font weight can also impact how easy text is to read. If you use a custom font with a thin weight, aim for larger than the recommended sizes to increase legibility.

| Platform | Default size | Minimum size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS, iPadOS | 17 pt | 11 pt |
| macOS | 13 pt | 10 pt |
| tvOS | 29 pt | 23 pt |
| visionOS | 17 pt | 12 pt |
| watchOS | 16 pt | 12 pt |

**Test legibility in different contexts.** For example, you need to test game text for legibility on each platform on which your game runs. If testing shows that some of your text is difficult to read, consider using a larger type size, increasing contrast by modifying the text or background colors, or using typefaces designed for optimized legibility, like the system fonts.

![A screenshot that shows a game running on iPhone in landscape. A name appears above each of 3 plants and a status message appears in a rounded rectangle in the top-right corner. All text uses a size that's too small, and the 3 plant names don't have visible backgrounds.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/aaf334356178859f6e86eb42913c53dd/game-typography-incorrect%402x.png)

Testing a game on a new platform can show where text is hard to read.

![A screenshot that shows a game running on iPhone in landscape. A name appears within a shaded lozenge shape above each of 3 plants and a status message appears in a rounded rectangle in the top-right corner. All text uses a size that's at least the recommended minimum.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/4c38de72c94767cbb6bd7763720ef281/game-typography-correct%402x.png)

Increasing text size and adding visible background shapes can help make text easier to read.

**In general, avoid light font weights.** For example, if you’re using system-provided fonts, prefer Regular, Medium, Semibold, or Bold font weights, and avoid Ultralight, Thin, and Light font weights, which can be difficult to see, especially when text is small.

## [Conveying hierarchy](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography\#Conveying-hierarchy)

**Adjust font weight, size, and color as needed to emphasize important information and help people visualize hierarchy.** Be sure to maintain the relative hierarchy and visual distinction of text elements when people adjust text sizes.

**Minimize the number of typefaces you use, even in a highly customized interface.** Mixing too many different typefaces can obscure your information hierarchy and hinder readability, in addition to making an interface feel internally inconsistent or poorly designed.

**Prioritize important content when responding to text-size changes.** Not all content is equally important. When someone chooses a larger text size, they typically want to make the content they care about easier to read; they don’t always want to increase the size of every word on the screen. For example, when people increase text size to read the content in a tabbed window, they don’t expect the tab titles to increase in size. Similarly, in a game, people are often more interested in a character’s dialog than in transient hit-damage values.

## [Using system fonts](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography\#Using-system-fonts)

Apple provides two typeface families that support an extensive range of weights, sizes, styles, and languages.

**San Francisco (SF)** is a sans serif typeface family that includes the SF Pro, SF Compact, SF Arabic, SF Armenian, SF Georgian, SF Hebrew, and SF Mono variants.

![The phrase 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.' shown in the San Francisco Pro font.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/e270b0f4e91f523bb7372a39447ad4e4/typography-sanfrancisco%402x.png)

The system also offers SF Pro, SF Compact, SF Arabic, SF Armenian, SF Georgian, and SF Hebrew in rounded variants you can use to coordinate text with the appearance of soft or rounded UI elements, or to provide an alternative typographic voice.

**New York (NY)** is a serif typeface family designed to work well by itself and alongside the SF fonts.

![The phrase 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.' shown in the New York font.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8dcb4d6f97b97a957a0d73e4ee85730c/typography-new-york%402x.png)

You can download the San Francisco and New York fonts [here](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).

The system provides the SF and NY fonts in the _variable_ font format, which combines different font styles together in one file, and supports interpolation between styles to create intermediate ones.

To help you define visual hierarchies and create clear and legible designs in many different sizes and contexts, the system fonts are available in a variety of weights, ranging from Ultralight to Black, and — in the case of SF — several widths, including Condensed and Expanded. Because SF Symbols use equivalent weights, you can achieve precise weight matching between symbols and adjacent text, regardless of the size or style you choose.

![The word 'text' shown in the SF Pro font, repeated in two rows of nine columns each. The rows show upright and italic styles, and the columns show font weights ranging from ultralight to black.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8b07ec795d9ad16c787edb0030018a09/font-weight-sf-pro%402x.png)

The system defines a set of typographic attributes — called text styles — that work with both typeface families. A _text style_ specifies a combination of font weight, point size, and leading values for each text size. For example, the _body_ text style uses values that support a comfortable reading experience over multiple lines of text, while the _headline_ style assigns a font size and weight that help distinguish a heading from surrounding content. Taken together, the text styles form a typographic hierarchy you can use to express the different levels of importance in your content. Text styles also allow text to scale proportionately when people change the system’s text size or make accessibility adjustments, like turning on Larger Text in Accessibility settings.

![A partial iPhone screenshot of a Mail inbox, showing how text styles convey hierarchy. At the top of the screen, the word Inbox is in the large title text style. Below that, the email sender's name is in the title text style, the email subject is in the subtitle text style, and the preview of the email's content is in the body text style.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/878872415cbf3bcb83541662457844a6/typography-text-hierarchy-levels%402x.png)

**Consider using the built-in text styles.** The system-defined text styles give you a convenient and consistent way to convey your information hierarchy through font size and weight. Using text styles with the system fonts also ensures support for Dynamic Type and larger accessibility type sizes (where available), which let people choose the text size that works for them. For guidance, see [Supporting Dynamic Type](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography#Supporting-Dynamic-Type).

**Modify the built-in text styles if necessary.** System APIs define font adjustments — called _symbolic traits_ — that let you modify some aspects of a text style. For example, the bold trait adds weight to text, letting you create another level of hierarchy. You can also use symbolic traits to adjust leading if you need to improve readability or conserve space. For example, when you display text in wide columns or long passages, more space between lines ( _loose leading_) can make it easier for people to keep their place while moving from one line to the next. Conversely, if you need to display multiple lines of text in an area where height is constrained — for example, in a list row — decreasing the space between lines ( _tight leading_) can help the text fit well. If you need to display three or more lines of text, avoid tight leading even in areas where height is limited. For developer guidance, see [`leading(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Font/leading(_:)).

**If necessary, adjust tracking in interface mockups.** In a running app, the system font dynamically adjusts tracking at every point size. To produce an accurate interface mockup of an interface that uses the variable system fonts, you don’t have to choose a discrete optical size at certain point sizes, but you might need to adjust the tracking. For guidance, see [Tracking values](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography#Tracking-values).

## [Using custom fonts](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography\#Using-custom-fonts)

**Make sure custom fonts are legible.** People need to be able to read your custom font easily at various viewing distances and under a variety of conditions. While using a custom font, be guided by the recommended minimum font sizes for various styles and weights in [Specifications](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography#Specifications).

**Implement accessibility features for custom fonts.** System fonts automatically support Dynamic Type (where available) and respond when people turn on accessibility features, such as Bold Text. If you use a custom font, make sure it implements the same behaviors. For developer guidance, see [Applying custom fonts to text](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Applying-Custom-Fonts-to-Text). In a Unity-based game, you can use [Apple’s Unity plug-ins](https://github.com/apple/unityplugins) to support Dynamic Type. If the plug-in isn’t appropriate for your game, be sure to let players adjust text size in other ways.

## [Supporting Dynamic Type](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography\#Supporting-Dynamic-Type)

Dynamic Type is a system-level feature in iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS that lets people adjust the size of visible text on their device to ensure readability and comfort. For related guidance, see [Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility).

Mail content at the largest accessibility text size

For a list of available Dynamic Type sizes, see [Specifications](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography#Specifications). You can also download Dynamic Type size tables in the [Apple Design Resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/) for each platform.

For developer guidance, see [Text input and output](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Text-input-and-output). To support Dynamic Type in Unity-based games, use [Apple’s Unity plug-ins](https://github.com/apple/unityplugins).

**Make sure your app’s layout adapts to all font sizes.** Verify that your design scales, and that text and glyphs are legible at all font sizes. On iPhone or iPad, turn on Larger Accessibility Text Sizes in Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Larger Text, and confirm that your app remains comfortably readable.

**Increase the size of meaningful interface icons as font size increases.** If you use interface icons to communicate important information, make sure they’re easy to view at larger font sizes too. When you use [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols), you get icons that scale automatically with Dynamic Type size changes.

**Keep text truncation to a minimum as font size increases.** In general, aim to display as much useful text at the largest accessibility font size as you do at the largest standard font size. Avoid truncating text in scrollable regions unless people can open a separate view to read the rest of the content. You can prevent text truncation in a label by configuring it to use as many lines as needed to display a useful amount of text. For developer guidance, see [`numberOfLines`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UILabel/numberOfLines).

**Consider adjusting your layout at large font sizes.** When font size increases in a horizontally constrained context, inline items (like glyphs and timestamps) and container boundaries can crowd text and cause truncation or overlapping. To improve readability, consider using a stacked layout where text appears above secondary items. Multicolumn text can also be less readable at large sizes due to horizontal space constraints. Reduce the number of columns when the font size increases to avoid truncation and enhance readability. For developer guidance, see [`isAccessibilityCategory`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIContentSizeCategory/isAccessibilityCategory).

**Maintain a consistent information hierarchy regardless of the current font size.** For example, keep primary elements toward the top of a view even when the font size is very large, so that people don’t lose track of these elements.

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography\#Platform-considerations)

### [iOS, iPadOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography\#iOS-iPadOS)

SF Pro is the system font in iOS and iPadOS. iOS and iPadOS apps can also use NY.

### [macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography\#macOS)

SF Pro is the system font in macOS. NY is available for Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst. macOS doesn’t support Dynamic Type.

**When necessary, use dynamic system font variants to match the text in standard controls.** Dynamic system font variants give your text the same look and feel of the text that appears in system-provided controls. Use the variants listed below to achieve a look that’s consistent with other apps on the platform.

| Dynamic font variant | API |

| System font | [`systemFont(ofSize:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSFont/systemFont(ofSize:)) |

### [tvOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography\#tvOS)

SF Pro is the system font in tvOS, and apps can also use NY.

### [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography\#visionOS)

SF Pro is the system font in visionOS. If you use NY, you need to specify the type styles you want.

visionOS uses bolder versions of the Dynamic Type body and title styles and it introduces Extra Large Title 1 and Extra Large Title 2 for wide, editorial-style layouts. For guidance using vibrancy to indicate hierarchy in text and symbols, see [Materials > visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials#visionOS).

**In general, prefer 2D text.** The more visual depth text characters have, the more difficult they can be to read. Although a small amount of 3D text can provide a fun visual element that draws people’s attention, if you’re going to display content that people need to read and understand, prefer using text that has little or no visual depth.

![A screenshot that shows the correct placement of 2D text on a window in visionOS.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/b7eca42cb50603b5ae1630781ce6d4c7/visionos-typography-2d-text-correct%402x.png)

![A screenshot that shows the incorrect placement of 3D text on a window in visionOS.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8568cd71b363e427fb91a874b8c30aa8/visionos-typography-3d-text-incorrect%402x.png)

![An X in a circle to indicate incorrect usage.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/209f6f0fc8ad99d9bf59e12d82d06584/crossout%402x.png)

**Make sure text looks good and remains legible when people scale it.** Use a text style that makes the text look good at full scale, then test it for legibility at different scales.

**Maximize the contrast between text and the background of its container.** By default, the system displays text in white, because this color tends to provide a strong contrast with the default system background material, making text easier to read. If you want to use a different text color, be sure to test it in a variety of contexts.

**If you need to display text that’s not on a background, consider making it bold to improve legibility.** In this situation, you generally want to avoid adding shadows to increase text contrast. The current space might not include a visual surface on which to cast an accurate shadow, and you can’t predict the size and density of shadow that would work well with a person’s current Environment.

**Keep text facing people as much as possible.** If you display text that’s associated with a point in space, such as a label for a 3D object, you generally want to use _billboarding_ — that is, you want the text to face the wearer regardless of how they or the object move. If you don’t rotate text to remain facing the wearer, the text can become impossible to read because people may view it from the side or a highly oblique angle. For example, imagine a virtual lamp that appears to be on a physical desk with a label anchored directly above it. For the text to remain readable, the label needs to rotate around the y-axis as people move around the desk; in other words, the baseline of the text needs to remain perpendicular to the person’s line of sight.

### [watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography\#watchOS)

SF Compact is the system font in watchOS, and apps can also use NY. In complications, watchOS uses SF Compact Rounded.

## [Specifications](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography\#Specifications)

You can display emphasized variants of system text styles using symbolic traits. In SwiftUI, use the [`bold()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Text/bold()) modifier; in UIKit, use [`traitBold`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIFontDescriptor/SymbolicTraits-swift.struct/traitBold) in the [`UIFontDescriptor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIFontDescriptor) API. The emphasized weights can be medium, semibold, bold, or heavy. The following specifications include the emphasized weight for each text style.

# Writing

The words you choose within your app are an essential part of its user experience.

![A sketch of a document and pencil, suggesting written content. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5bd05331c62b850b25ac62f8581b97b6/foundations-writing-intro%402x.png)

Whether you’re building an onboarding experience, writing an alert, or describing an image for accessibility, designing through the lens of language will help people get the most from your app or game.

## [Getting started](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/writing\#Getting-started)

**Determine your app’s voice.** Think about who you’re talking to, so you can figure out the type of vocabulary you’ll use. What types of words are familiar to people using your app? How do you want people to feel? The words for a banking app might convey trust and stability, for example, while the words in a game might convey excitement and fun. Create a list of common terms, and reference that list to keep your language consistent. Consistent language, along with a voice that reflects your app’s values, helps everything feel more cohesive.

**Match your tone to the context.** Once you’ve established your app’s voice, vary your tone based on the situation. Consider what people are doing while they’re using your app — both in the physical world and within the app itself. Are they exercising and reached a goal? Or are they trying to make a payment and received an error? Situational factors affect both what you say and how you display the text on the screen.

Compare the tone of these two examples from Apple Watch. In the first, the tone is straightforward and direct, reflecting the seriousness of the situation. In the second, the tone is light and congratulatory.

![A screenshot of a Fall Detection message that reads: it looks like you've taken a hard fall.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/6f5dc2b2e349ff901f831b3ba2c109c5/writing-fall-detection-message%402x.png)

![A screenshot of an Activity message that reads: you set a personal record for your longest daily Move streak, 35 days!](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/55bb6afa80bc2f2034a1909d7f672bfc/writing-move-streak-message%402x.png)

**Be clear.** Choose words that are easily understood and convey the right thing. Check each word to be sure it needs to be there. If you can use fewer words, do so. When in doubt, read your writing out loud.

**Write for everyone.** For your app to be useful for as many people as possible, it needs to speak to as many people as possible. Choose simple, plain language and write with accessibility and localization in mind, avoiding jargon and gendered terminology. For guidance, see [Writing inclusively](https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/#/apdcb2a65d68) and [VoiceOver](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/voiceover); for developer guidance, see [Localization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localization).

## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/writing\#Best-practices)

**Consider each screen’s purpose**. Pay attention to the order of elements on a screen, and put the most important information first. Format your text to make it easy to read. If you’re trying to convey more than one idea, consider breaking up the text onto multiple screens, and think about the flow of information across those screens.

**Be action oriented.** Active voice and clear labels help people navigate through your app from one step to the next, or from one screen to another. When labeling buttons and links, it’s almost always best to use a verb. Prioritize clarity and avoid the temptation to be too cute or clever with your labels. For example, just saying “Send” often works better than “Let’s do it!” For links, avoid using “Click here” in favor of more descriptive words or phrases, such as “Learn more about UX Writing.” This is especially important for people using screen readers to access your app.

**Build language patterns.** Consistency builds familiarity, helping your app feel cohesive, intuitive, and thoughtfully designed. It also makes writing for your app easier, as you can return to these patterns again and again.

**Adopt capitalization rules that align with your app’s style, then apply them consistently.** While certain components, like [button labels](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/buttons#Content), have specific guidelines, how you format text reflects your app’s voice. Title case is generally considered formal, while sentence case is more casual. Choose a style for each UI element type and use it consistently throughout your app — for example, title case for all alerts or sentence case for all headlines.

**Give clear guidance and use consistent language throughout processes with multiple steps.** If your app has a flow that spans multiple screens, decide how you want to label the actions that take people from one step to the next. Begin with language like “Get Started” to indicate you’re starting a flow. You can use the button label to hint at the next step, or use terms like “Continue” or “Next,” but be consistent with what you choose. Make it clear when a flow is complete by using language like “Done.”

**Use possessive pronouns sparingly.** Possessive pronouns like _my_ and _your_ are often unnecessary to establish context. For example, “Favorites” conveys the same message as “Your Favorites,” and is more succinct. If you do use possessive pronouns, use them consistently throughout your app, and try not to switch perspectives. Avoid using _we_ altogether because it may be unclear who the “we” in question refers to. This is particularly problematic in error messages like “We’re having trouble loading this content.” Something like “Unable to load content” is much clearer.

**Write for how people use each device.** People may use your app on several types of devices. While your language needs to be consistent across them, think about where it would be helpful to adjust your text to make it suitable for different devices. Make sure you describe gestures correctly on each device — for example, not saying “click” for a touch device like iPhone or iPad where you mean “tap.”

Where and how people use a device, its screen size, and its location all affect how you write for your app. iPhone and Apple Watch, for example, offer opportunities for personalization, but their small screens require brevity. TVs, on the other hand, are often in common living spaces, and several people are likely to see anything on the screen, so consider who you’re addressing. Bigger screens also require brevity, as the text must be large for people to see it from a distance.

**Provide clear next steps on any blank screens.** An empty state, like a completed to-do list or bookmarks folder with nothing in it, can provide a good opportunity to make people feel welcome and educate them about your app. Empty states can also showcase your app’s voice, but make sure that the content is useful and fits the context. An empty screen can be daunting if it isn’t obvious what to do next, so guide people on actions they can take, and give them a button or link to do so if possible. Remember that empty states are usually temporary, so don’t show crucial information that could then disappear.

**Write clear error messages.** It’s always best to help people avoid errors. When an error message is necessary, display it as close to the problem as possible, avoid blame, and be clear about what someone can do to fix it. For example, “That password is too short” isn’t as helpful as “Choose a password with at least 8 characters.” Remember that errors can be frustrating. Interjections like “oops!” or “uh-oh” are typically unnecessary and can sound insincere. If you find that language alone can’t address an error that’s likely to affect many people, use that as an opportunity to rethink the interaction.

**Choose the right delivery method.** There are many ways to get people’s attention, whether or not they are actively using your app. When there’s something you want to communicate, consider the urgency and importance of the message. Think about the context in which someone might see the message, whether it requires immediate action, and how much supporting information someone might need. Choose the correct delivery method, and use a tone appropriate for the situation. For guidance, see [Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/notifications), [Alerts](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/alerts), and [Action sheets](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/action-sheets).

**Keep settings labels clear and simple.** Help people easily find the settings they need by labeling them as practically as possible. If the setting label isn’t enough, add an explanation. Describe what it does when turned on, and people can infer the opposite. In the Handwashing Timer setting for Apple Watch, for example, the description explains that a timer can start when you’re washing your hands. It isn’t necessary to tell you that a timer won’t start when this setting is off.

![A partial screenshot showing the Handwashing Timer description, which reads: Apple Watch can detect when you're washing your hands and start a 20-second timer.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/f368879d77e8dfdff158067bc3888c5f/writing-handwashing-settings%402x.png)

If you need to direct someone to a setting, provide a direct link or button, rather than trying to describe its location. For guidance, see [Settings](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/settings).

**Show hints in text fields.** If your app allows people to enter their own text, like account or contact information, label all fields clearly, and use hint or placeholder text so people know how to format the information. You can give an example in hint text, like “name@example.com,” or describe the information, such as “Your name.” Show errors right next to the field, and instruct people how to enter the information correctly, rather than scolding them for not following the rules. “Use only letters for your name” is better than “Don’t use numbers or symbols.” Avoid robotic error messages with no helpful information, like “Invalid name.” For guidance, see [Text fields](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/text-fields).

# App icons

A unique, memorable icon expresses your app’s or game’s purpose and personality and helps people recognize it at a glance.

![A sketch of the App Store icon. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/05b8bbb4aac9f98ba8c77876fe5068b7/foundations-app-icons-intro%402x.png)

Your app icon is a crucial aspect of your app’s or game’s branding and user experience. It appears on the Home Screen and in key locations throughout the system, including search results, notifications, system settings, and share sheets. A well-designed app icon conveys your app’s or game’s identity clearly and consistently across all Apple platforms.

![An image that shows three variations of the Photos app's app icon as it appears on different platforms. The first variation is a rounded rectangle shape, and represents the iOS, iPadOS, and macOS icons. The second variation is an elongated, rounded rectangular shape, and represents the tvOS icon. The third variation is a circular shape, and represents the visionOS and watchOS icons. All variations have the same overall design over different background shapes.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/298204fa29c2dc771deb8651963ce75a/app-icons-platform-appearance-overview%402x.png)

## [Layer design](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons\#Layer-design)

Although you can provide a flattened image for your icon, layers give you the most control over how your icon design is represented. A layered app icon comes together to produce a sense of depth and vitality. On each platform, the system applies visual effects that respond to the environment and people’s interactions.

iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS app icons include a background layer and one or more foreground layers that coalesce to create dimensionality. These icons take on Liquid Glass attributes like specular highlights, frostiness, and translucency, which respond to changes in lighting and, in iOS and iPadOS, device movement.

iOS app icon

tvOS app icons use between two and five layers to create a sense of dynamism as people bring them into focus. When focused, the app icon elevates to the foreground in response to someone’s finger movement on their remote, and gently sways while the surface illuminates. The separation between layers and the use of transparency produce a feeling of depth during the parallax effect.

tvOS app icon

A visionOS app icon includes a background layer and one or two layers on top, producing a three-dimensional object that subtly expands when people view it. The system enhances the icon’s visual dimensionality by adding shadows that convey a sense of depth between layers and by using the alpha channel of the upper layers to create an embossed appearance.

You use your favorite design tool to craft the individual foreground layers of your app icon. For iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS icons, you then import your icon layers into Icon Composer, a design tool included with Xcode and available from the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/icon-composer). In Icon Composer, you define the background layer for your icon, adjust your foreground layer placement, apply visual effects like transparency, define default, dark, clear, and tinted appearance variants, and export your icon for use in Xcode. For additional guidance, see [Creating your app icon using Icon Composer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/creating-your-app-icon-using-icon-composer).

![A screenshot of the Photos app icon in Icon Composer.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/3d4f8c4c6b744e77f32802201fb48fb7/app-icons-icon-composer-overview-photos%402x.png)Icon Composer

For tvOS and visionOS app icons, you add your icon layers directly to an image stack in Xcode to form your complete icon. For developer guidance, see [Configuring your app icon using an asset catalog](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/configuring-your-app-icon).

**Prefer clearly defined edges in foreground layers.** To ensure system-drawn highlights and shadows look best, avoid soft and feathered edges on foreground layer shapes.

**Vary opacity in foreground layers to increase the sense of depth and liveliness.** For example, the Photos icon separates its centerpiece into multiple layers that contain translucent pieces, bringing greater dynamism to the design. Importing fully opaque layers and adjusting transparency in Icon Composer lets you preview and make adjustments to your design based on how transparency and system effects impact one another.

**Design a background that both stands out and emphasizes foreground content.** Subtle top-to-bottom, light-to-dark gradients tend to respond well to system lighting effects. Icon Composer supports solid colors and gradients for background layers, making it unnecessary to import custom background images in most cases. If you do import a background layer, make sure it’s full-bleed and opaque.

**Prefer vector graphics when bringing layers into Icon Composer.** Unlike raster images, vector graphics (such as SVG or PDF) scale gracefully and appear crisp at any size. Outline artwork and convert text to outline in your design. For mesh gradients and raster artwork, prefer PNG format because it’s a lossless image format.

## [Icon shape](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons\#Icon-shape)

An app icon’s shape varies based on a platform’s visual language. In iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, icons are square, and the system applies masking to produce rounded corners that precisely match the curvature of other rounded interface elements throughout the system and the bezel of the physical device itself. In tvOS, icons are rectangular, also with concentric edges. In visionOS and watchOS, icons are square and the system applies circular masking.

![An image of the Settings icon for iOS. The iOS, iPadOS, and macOS icon grid is overlaid on the icon to show how the icon's shape and its elements map to the grid.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/a116649a6bdc5124779475fcd769caac/app-icons-settings-app-grid-square%402x.png)

![An image of the Settings icon for tvOS. The tvOS icon grid is overlaid on the icon to show how the icon's shape and its elements map to the grid.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/770ec58a9f9985410cdff8c38b8166ab/app-icons-settings-app-grid-rectangle%402x.png)

![An image of the Settings icon for watchOS. The visionOS and watchOS icon grid is overlaid on the icon to show how the icon's shape and its elements map to the grid.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/2ceefd0eeb7e039a43ab05fd4a5050fb/app-icons-settings-app-grid-circle%402x.png)

**Produce appropriately shaped, unmasked layers.** The system masks all layer edges to produce an icon’s final shape. For iOS, iPadOS, and macOS icons, provide square layers so the system can apply rounded corners. For visionOS and watchOS, provide square layers so the system can create the circular icon shape. For tvOS, provide rectangular layers so the system can apply rounded corners. Providing layers with pre-defined masking negatively impacts specular highlight effects and makes edges look jagged.

**Keep primary content centered to avoid truncation when the system adjusts corners or applies masking.** Pay particular attention to centering content in visionOS and watchOS icons. To help with icon placement, use the grids in the app icon production templates, which you can find in [Apple Design Resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/).

## [Design](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons\#Design)

Embrace simplicity in your icon design. Simple icons tend to be easiest for people to understand and recognize. An icon with fine visual features might look busy when rendered with system-provided shadows and highlights, and details may be hard to discern at smaller sizes. Find a concept or element that captures the essence of your app or game, make it the core idea of your icon, and express it in a simple, unique way with a minimal number of shapes. Prefer a simple background, such as a solid color or gradient, that puts the emphasis on your primary design — you don’t need to fill the entire icon canvas with content.

![An image of the Podcasts app icon.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/58a62b07273dbbc302df7a428103a16e/app-icons-embrace-simplicity-podcasts%402x.png)The Podcasts app icon

**Provide a visually consistent icon design across all the platforms your app supports.** A consistent design helps people quickly find your app wherever it appears and prevents people from mistaking your app for multiple apps.

**Consider basing your icon design around filled, overlapping shapes.** Overlapping solid shapes in the foreground, particularly when paired with transparency and blurring, can give an icon a sense of depth.

![An illustration of two circles centered above a grid. One circle encloses the other. The inner circle has a solid fill. The outer circle is larger than the inner circle, allowing some space between them. The outer circle has no fill and shows just an outline.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/6b02e91996a97adb2dbe53a8131cc380/app-icons-element-outline-shape%402x.png)

![An illustration of two circles centered above a grid. One circle encloses the other. The inner circle has a solid fill. The outer circle is larger than the inner circle, has no outline, and has a semi-transparent fill that allows the background grid to show through.

![A checkmark in a circle to indicate correct usage.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/88662da92338267bb64cd2275c84e484/checkmark%402x.png)

**Include text only when it’s essential to your experience or brand.** Text in icons doesn’t support accessibility or localization, is often too small to read easily, and can make an icon appear cluttered. In some contexts, your app name already appears nearby, making it redundant to display the name within the icon itself. Although displaying a mnemonic like the first letter of your app’s name can help people recognize your app or game, avoid including nonessential words that tell people what to do with it — like “Watch” or “Play” — or context-specific terms like “New” or “For visionOS.” If you include text in a tvOS app icon, make sure it’s above other layers so it’s not cropped by the parallax effect.

**Prefer illustrations to photos and avoid replicating UI components.** Photos are full of details that don’t work well when displayed in different appearances, viewed at small sizes, or split into layers. Instead of using photos, create a graphic representation of the content that emphasizes the features you want people to notice. Similarly, if your app has an interface that people recognize, don’t just replicate standard UI components or use app screenshots in your icon.

**Don’t use replicas of Apple hardware products.** Apple products are copyrighted and can’t be reproduced in your app icons.

## [Visual effects](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons\#Visual-effects)

**Let the system handle blurring and other visual effects.** The system dynamically applies visual effects to your app icon layers, so there’s no need to include specular highlights, drop shadows between layers, beveled edges, blurs, glows, and other effects. In addition to interfering with system-provided effects, custom effects are static, whereas the system supplies dynamic ones. If you do include custom visual effects on your icon layers, use them intentionally and test carefully with Icon Composer, in Simulator, or on device to make sure they appear as expected and don’t conflict with system effects.

**Create layer groupings to apply effects to multiple layers at once.** System effects typically occur on individual layers. If it makes sense for your design, however, you can group several layers together in Icon Composer or your design tool so effects occur at the group level.

## [Appearances](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons\#Appearances)

In iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, people can choose whether their Home Screen app icons are default, dark, clear, or tinted in appearance. For example, someone may want to personalize their app icon appearance to complement their wallpaper. You can design app icon variants for every appearance variant, and the system automatically generates variants you don’t provide.

![A grid showing the six different appearances of the Photos app icon in iOS. The top row shows the default, clear light, and tinted light icon variants. The bottom row shows the dark, clear dark, and tinted dark variants.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/a91b68946df73b81596a9a29b0356a4a/app-icons-rendering-modes%402x.png)

**Keep your icon’s features consistent across appearances.** To create a seamless experience, keep your icon’s core visual features the same in the default, dark, clear, and tinted appearances. Avoid creating custom icon variants that swap elements in and out with each variant, which may make it harder for people to find your app when they switch appearances.

**Design dark and tinted icons that feel at home beside system app icons and widgets.** You can preserve the color palette of your default icon, but be mindful that dark icons are more subdued, and clear and tinted icons are even more so. A great app icon is visible, legible, and recognizable, regardless of its appearance variant.

**Use your light app icon as the basis for your dark icon.** Choose complementary colors that reflect the default design, and avoid excessively bright images. Color backgrounds generally offer the greatest contrast in dark icons. For guidance, see [Dark Mode](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode).

**Consider offering alternate app icons.** In iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and compatible apps running in visionOS, it’s possible to let people visit your app’s settings to choose an alternate version of your app icon. For example, a sports app might offer icons for different teams, letting someone choose their favorite. If you offer this capability, make sure each icon you design remains closely related to your content and experience. Avoid creating one someone might mistake for another app.

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons\#Platform-considerations)

_No additional considerations for iOS, iPadOS, or macOS._

### [tvOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons\#tvOS)

**Include a safe zone to ensure the system doesn’t crop your content.** When someone focuses your app icon, the system may crop content around the edges as the icon scales and moves. To ensure that your icon’s content is always visible, keep a safe zone around it. Be aware that the safe zone can vary, depending on the image size, layer depth, and motion, and the system crops foreground layers more than background layers.

![A diagram of the Photos app icon in tvOS with a white dotted line inside the outer border, which indicates the safe zone.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/f2f3bf70c87e53889768b64a2faf5cf5/tvos-app-icon-safe-zone%402x.png)

### [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons\#visionOS)

**Avoid adding a shape that’s intended to look like a hole or concave area to the background layer.** The system-added shadow and specular highlights can make such a shape stand out instead of recede.

### [watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons\#watchOS)

**Avoid using black for your icon’s background.** Lighten a black background so the icon doesn’t blend into the display background.

## [Specifications](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons\#Specifications)

The layout, size, style, and appearances of app icons vary by platform.

| Platform | Layout shape | Icon shape after system masking | Layout size | Style | Appearances |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| iOS, iPadOS, macOS | Square | Rounded rectangle (square) | 1024x1024 px | Layered | Default, dark, clear light, clear dark, tinted light, tinted dark |
| tvOS | Rectangle (landscape) | Rounded rectangle (rectangular) | 800x480 px | Layered (Parallax) | N/A |
| visionOS | Square | Circular | 1024x1024 px | Layered (3D) | N/A |
| watchOS | Square | Circular | 1088x1088 px | Layered | N/A |

The system automatically scales your icon to produce smaller variants that appear in certain locations, such as Settings and notifications.

App icons support the following color spaces:

- sRGB (color)

- Gray Gamma 2.2 (grayscale)

- Display P3 (wide-gamut color in iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS only)

# Icons

An effective icon is a graphic asset that expresses a single concept in ways people instantly understand.

![A sketch of the Command key icon. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/e71f139e5e50d9d10d91830b0af405c1/foundations-icons-intro%402x.png)

Apps and games use a variety of simple icons to help people understand the items, actions, and modes they can choose. Unlike [app icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons), which can use rich visual details like shading, texturing, and highlighting to evoke the app’s personality, an _interface icon_ typically uses streamlined shapes and touches of color to communicate a straightforward idea.

You can design interface icons — also called _glyphs_ — or you can choose symbols from the SF Symbols app, using them as-is or customizing them to suit your needs. Both interface icons and symbols use black and clear colors to define their shapes; the system can apply other colors to the black areas in each image. For guidance, see [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols).

## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons\#Best-practices)

**Create a recognizable, highly simplified design.** Too many details can make an interface icon confusing or unreadable. Strive for a simple, universal design that most people will recognize quickly. In general, icons work best when they use familiar visual metaphors that are directly related to the actions they initiate or content they represent.

**Maintain visual consistency across all interface icons in your app.** Whether you use only custom icons or mix custom and system-provided ones, all interface icons in your app need to use a consistent size, level of detail, stroke thickness (or weight), and perspective. Depending on the visual weight of an icon, you may need to adjust its dimensions to ensure that it appears visually consistent with other icons.

![Diagram of four glyphs in a row. From the left, the glyphs are a camera, a heart, an envelope, and an alarm clock. Two horizontal dashed lines show the bottom and top boundaries of the row and a horizontal red line shows the midpoint. All four glyphs are solid black; some include interior detail lines in white. Parts of the alarm clock extend above the top dashed line because its lighter visual weight requires greater height to achieve balance with the other glyphs.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/f1cf8ce0ca53b7cb3bce1391a378f6ce/custom-icon-sizes%402x.png)To help achieve visual consistency, adjust individual icon sizes as necessary…

![Diagram of the same four glyphs shown above and the same horizontal dashed lines at top and bottom and horizontal red line through the middle. In this diagram, all four glyphs are solid gray; the interior detail lines are black to emphasize that all lines use the same weight.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/91320cdd7a31574df355383d83eb1ceb/custom-icon-line-weights%402x.png)…and use the same stroke weight in every icon.

**In general, match the weights of interface icons and adjacent text.** Unless you want to emphasize either the icons or the text, using the same weight for both gives your content a consistent appearance and level of emphasis.

**If necessary, add padding to a custom interface icon to achieve optical alignment.** Some icons — especially asymmetric ones — can look unbalanced when you center them geometrically instead of optically. For example, the download icon shown below has more visual weight on the bottom than on the top, which can make it look too low if it’s geometrically centered.

![Two images of a white arrow that points down to a white horizontal line segment within a black disk. The image on the right includes two horizontal pink bars — one between the top of the glyph and the top of the disk and the other between the bottom of the glyph and the bottom of the disk — that show the glyph is geometrically centered within the disk.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/1c13eed753a1ebcfd6d35929738476c7/asymmetric-glyph%402x.png)An asymmetric icon can look off center even though it’s not.

In such cases, you can slightly adjust the position of the icon until it’s optically centered. When you create an asset that includes your adjustments as padding around an interface icon (as shown below on the right), you can optically center the icon by geometrically centering the asset.

![Two images of a white arrow that points down to a white horizontal line segment within a black disk. The image on the left includes the two horizontal pink bars in the same locations as in the previous illustration, but the glyph has been moved up by a few pixels. The image on the right includes a pink rectangle overlaid on top of the glyph to represent a padding area, which includes the extra pixels below the glyph.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/c31bce31456820badff997c95db264c6/asymmetric-glyph-optically-centered%402x.png)Moving the icon a few pixels higher optically centers it; including the pixels in padding simplifies centering.

Adjustments for optical centering are typically very small, but they can have a big impact on your app’s appearance.

![Two images of a white arrow that points down to a white horizontal line segment within a black disk. The glyph on the left is geometrically centered and the one on the right is optically centered.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5d9da37476ee3225a29ce3efbfd86cac/asymmetric-glyph-before-and-after%402x.png)Before optical centering (left) and after optical centering (right).

**Provide a selected-state version of an interface icon only if necessary.** You don’t need to provide selected and unselected appearances for an icon that’s used in standard system components such as toolbars, tab bars, and buttons. The system updates the visual appearance of the selected state automatically.

![An image of two toolbar buttons that share a background. The left button shows the Filter icon in a selected state, using a blue tint color for its background. The right button shows the More icon in an unselected state, using the default appearance for toolbar buttons.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/b5c874fca24c428b421c008b29709986/icons-selection-correct%402x.png)In a toolbar, a selected icon receives the app’s accent color.

**Use inclusive images.** Consider how your icons can be understandable and welcoming to everyone. Prefer depicting gender-neutral human figures and avoid images that might be hard to recognize across different cultures or languages. For guidance, see [Inclusion](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion).

**Include text in your design only when it’s essential for conveying meaning.** For example, using a character in an interface icon that represents text formatting can be the most direct way to communicate the concept. If you need to display individual characters in your icon, be sure to localize them. If you need to suggest a passage of text, design an abstract representation of it, and include a flipped version of the icon to use when the context is right-to-left. For guidance, see [Right to left](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left).

![A partial screenshot of the SF Symbols app showing the info panel for the character symbol, which looks like the capital letter A. Below the image, the following eight localized versions of the symbol are listed: Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Chinese.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/1037fd04c26206ca1b1dee2e34e123af/character-in-glyph%402x.png)Create localized versions of an icon that displays individual characters.

![A partial screenshot of the SF Symbols app showing the info panel for the text dot page symbol, which looks like three left-aligned horizontal lines inside a rounded rectangle. Below the image, the left-to-right and right-to-left localized versions are shown.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/2edc8ff4ae7af79f32543009ba2f7084/abstract-text-in-glyph%402x.png)Create a flipped version of an icon that suggests reading direction.

**If you create a custom interface icon, use a vector format like PDF or SVG.** The system automatically scales a vector-based interface icon for high-resolution displays, so you don’t need to provide high-resolution versions of it. In contrast, PNG — used for app icons and other images that include effects like shading, textures, and highlighting — doesn’t support scaling, so you have to supply multiple versions for each PNG-based interface icon. Alternatively, you can create a custom SF Symbol and specify a scale that ensures the symbol’s emphasis matches adjacent text. For guidance, see [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols).

**Provide alternative text labels for custom interface icons.** Alternative text labels — or accessibility descriptions — aren’t visible, but they let VoiceOver audibly describe what’s onscreen, simplifying navigation for people with visual disabilities. For guidance, see [VoiceOver](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/voiceover).

**Avoid using replicas of Apple hardware products.** Hardware designs tend to change frequently and can make your interface icons and other content appear dated. If you must display Apple hardware, use only the images available in [Apple Design Resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/) or the SF Symbols that represent various Apple products.

## [Standard icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons\#Standard-icons)

For icons to represent common actions in [menus](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/menus), [toolbars](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/toolbars), [buttons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/buttons), and other places in interfaces across Apple platforms, you can use these [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols).

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons\#Platform-considerations)

_No additional considerations for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS._

### [macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons\#macOS)

#### [Document icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons\#Document-icons)

If your macOS app can use a custom document type, you can create a document icon to represent it. Traditionally, a document icon looks like a piece of paper with its top-right corner folded down. This distinctive appearance helps people distinguish documents from apps and other content, even when icon sizes are small.

If you don’t supply a document icon for a file type you support, macOS creates one for you by compositing your app icon and the file’s extension onto the canvas. For example, Preview uses a system-generated document icon to represent JPG files.

![An image of the Preview document icon for a JPG file.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/bfe462604c63811cb542e7c0fc46185e/doc-icon-generated%402x.png)

In some cases, it can make sense to create a set of document icons to represent a range of file types your app handles. For example, Xcode uses custom document icons to help people distinguish projects, AR objects, and Swift code files.

![Image of an Xcode project document icon.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8cd56a7291cd6b41fe391958f704c823/doc-icon-custom-1%402x.png)

![Image of a document icon for an AR object.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/a1449177968f693c1bd68c2b146df7c3/doc-icon-custom-2%402x.png)

To create a custom document icon, you can supply any combination of background fill, center image, and text. The system layers, positions, and masks these elements as needed and composites them onto the familiar folded-corner icon shape.

![A custom document icon that displays the pink heart and the word heart on top of the pink grid and white EKG line.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/d5da9148d27f60891780ab1a9546a111/doc-icon-parts%402x.png)macOS composites the elements you supply to produce your custom document icon.

[Apple Design Resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/#macos-apps) provides a template you can use to create a custom background fill and center image for a document icon. As you use this template, follow the guidelines below.

**Design simple images that clearly communicate the document type.** Whether you use a background fill, a center image, or both, prefer uncomplicated shapes and a reduced palette of distinct colors. Your document icon can display as small as 16x16 px, so you want to create designs that remain recognizable at every size.

**Designing a single, expressive image for the background fill can be a great way to help people understand and recognize a document type.** For example, Xcode and TextEdit both use rich background images that don’t include a center image.

![Image of an Xcode project document icon.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8cd56a7291cd6b41fe391958f704c823/doc-icon-custom-1%402x.png)

![Image of a TextEdit rich text document icon.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/f32709a5ff5742e79fd03a58ae1dd9c6/doc-icon-fill-only%402x.png)

**Consider reducing complexity in the small versions of your document icon.** Icon details that are clear in large versions can look blurry and be hard to recognize in small versions. For example, to ensure that the grid lines in the custom heart document icon remain clear in intermediate sizes, you might use fewer lines and thicken them by aligning them to the reduced pixel grid. In the 16x16 px size, you might remove the lines altogether.

![Pixelated image of the heart document icon. The grid, the EKG line, the heart shape, and the word heart are visible but blurry.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/1f8bc7946a75363224f373924b557a3a/doc-icon-fewer-details-1%402x.png)The 32x32 px icon has fewer grid lines and a thicker EKG line.

![Pixelated image of the heart document icon, in which only the blurry heart shape and EKG line are visible.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/e46ac887801d9a16393948c3f2098715/doc-icon-fewer-details-2%402x.png)The 16x16 px @2x icon retains the EKG line but has no grid lines.

![Pixelated image of the heart document icon, in which only the blurry heart shape is visible.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/fd0d2afcd76a9b25c1217ef2ffb1ad0e/doc-icon-fewer-details-3%402x.png)The 16x16 px @1x icon has no EKG line and no grid lines.

**Avoid placing important content in the top-right corner of your background fill.** The system automatically masks your image to fit the document icon shape and draws the white folded corner on top of the fill. Create a set of background images in the sizes listed below.

- 512x512 px @1x, 1024x1024 px @2x

- 256x256 px @1x, 512x512 px @2x

- 128x128 px @1x, 256x256 px @2x

- 32x32 px @1x, 64x64 px @2x

- 16x16 px @1x, 32x32 px @2x

**If a familiar object can convey a document’s type or its connection with your app, consider creating a center image that depicts it.** Design a simple, unambiguous image that’s clear and recognizable at every size. The center image measures half the size of the overall document icon canvas. For example, to create a center image for a 32x32 px document icon, use an image canvas that measures 16x16 px. You can provide center images in the following sizes:

- 256x256 px @1x, 512x512 px @2x

- 128x128 px @1x, 256x256 px @2x

- 32x32 px @1x, 64x64 px @2x

- 16x16 px @1x, 32x32 px @2x

**Define a margin that measures about 10% of the image canvas and keep most of the image within it.** Although parts of the image can extend into this margin for optical alignment, it’s best when the image occupies about 80% of the image canvas. For example, most of the center image in a 256x256 px canvas would fit in an area that measures 205x205 px.

![Diagram of the solid pink heart shape within blue margins that measure 10 percent of the canvas width.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/7cc19b2ae1e99d26ba69e1351683ede1/doc-icon-parts-margins%402x.png)

**Specify a succinct term if it helps people understand your document type.** By default, the system displays a document’s extension at the bottom edge of the document icon, but if the extension is unfamiliar you can supply a more descriptive term. For example, the document icon for a SceneKit scene file uses the term _scene_ instead of the file extension _scn_. The system automatically scales the extension text to fit in the document icon, so be sure to use a term that’s short enough to be legible at small sizes. By default, the system capitalizes every letter in the text.

![Image of a SceneKit scene document icon.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/3b4bb7de9edb5870d3a162aae8153163/doc-icon-custom-extension%402x.png)

# SF Symbols

SF Symbols provides thousands of consistent, highly configurable symbols that integrate seamlessly with the San Francisco system font, automatically aligning with text in all weights and sizes.

![A sketch of the SF Symbols icon. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/06d528652b87b23f1cecaf5faceedf30/foundations-sf-symbols-intro%402x.png)

You can use a symbol to convey an object or concept wherever interface icons can appear, such as in toolbars, tab bars, context menus, and within text.

Availability of individual symbols and features varies based on the version of the system you’re targeting. Symbols and symbol features introduced in a given year aren’t available in earlier operating systems.

Visit [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) to download the app and browse the full set of symbols. Be sure to understand the terms and conditions for using SF Symbols, including the prohibition against using symbols — or images that are confusingly similar — in app icons, logos, or any other trademarked use. For developer guidance, see [Configuring and displaying symbol images in your UI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/configuring-and-displaying-symbol-images-in-your-ui).

## [Rendering modes](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols\#Rendering-modes)

SF Symbols provides four rendering modes — monochrome, hierarchical, palette, and multicolor — that give you multiple options when applying color to symbols. For example, you might want to use multiple opacities of your app’s accent color to give symbols depth and emphasis, or specify a palette of contrasting colors to display symbols that coordinate with various color schemes.

To support the rendering modes, SF Symbols organizes a symbol’s paths into distinct layers. For example, the `cloud.sun.rain.fill` symbol consists of three layers: the primary layer contains the cloud paths, the secondary layer contains the paths that define the sun and its rays, and the tertiary layer contains the raindrop paths.

![An image of the cloud sun rain fill symbol. The cloud is black and the raindrops and sun are gray to indicate that the cloud is in the primary layer.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/42c350caa5e5117d40d45ac28c258832/sf-three-layers-primary%402x.png)Primary

![An image of the cloud sun rain fill symbol. The sun is black and the raindrops and cloud are gray to indicate that the sun is in the secondary layer.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/9acc461ef73c512ab21e4713fcdc75a3/sf-three-layers-secondary%402x.png)Secondary

![An image of the cloud sun rain fill symbol. The raindrops are black and the sun and cloud are gray to indicate that the raindrops are in the primary layer.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/f2ec783b9aedc7f59c3485efb83fbb94/sf-three-layers-tertiary%402x.png)Tertiary

Depending on the rendering mode you choose, a symbol can produce various appearances. For example, Hierarchical rendering mode assigns a different opacity of a single color to each layer, creating a visual hierarchy that gives depth to the symbol.

![An image of the cloud sun rain fill symbol that uses three different opacities of the system blue color in the symbol’s three different layers: the cloud is fully opaque, the sun is about 50% opaque, and the raindrops are about 25% opaque.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/35fe9f56dee989f094845e640951fef5/sf-three-layers-color%402x.png)

To learn more about supporting rendering modes in custom symbols, see [Custom symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#Custom-symbols).

SF Symbols supports the following rendering modes.

**Monochrome** — Applies one color to all layers in a symbol. Within a symbol, paths render in the color you specify or as a transparent shape within a color-filled path.

![A diagram showing a row of eight symbols, all of which use a single opacity of the system blue color.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/b296a9ee1b06b49c011209c83b537096/sf-monochrome%402x.png)

**Hierarchical** — Applies one color to all layers in a symbol, varying the color’s opacity according to each layer’s hierarchical level.

![A diagram showing a row of eight symbols, each of which uses different opacities of the system blue color. From the left, the square and arrow up symbol uses full opacity for the arrow and low opacity in the square. Next, folder badge plus uses full opacity for the badge and low opacity for the folder. Trash slash uses full opacity for the slash and low opacity for the can. Calendar day timeline right uses full opacity for the horizontal indicator and low opacity for the square and dots. List number uses full opacity for the column of numbers and low opacity for the horizontal lines. Text format A B C dotted underline uses full opacity for the dots under the low-opacity letters. iPhone radio waves left and right uses full opacity for the device outline, mid opacity in the screen area, and low opacity for the radio wave lines. Lastly, the PC symbol uses full opacity for the device outline and the onscreen sad face and horizontal lines and mid opacity in the screen background.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/c035476f6266b094b051d4e392329092/sf-hierarchical%402x.png)

**Palette** — Applies two or more colors to a symbol, using one color per layer. Specifying only two colors for a symbol that defines three levels of hierarchy means the secondary and tertiary layers use the same color.

![A diagram showing a row of eight symbols, each of which uses a combination of gray and the system blue color. From the left, the square and arrow up symbol uses blue for the arrow and light gray for the square. Next, folder badge plus uses blue for the badge and light gray for the folder. Trash slash uses blue for the slash and light gray for the can. Calendar day timeline right uses blue for the horizontal indicator and light gray for the square and dots. List number uses blue for the column of numbers and light gray for the horizontal lines. Text format A B C dotted underline uses blue for the dots under the light gray letters. iPhone radio waves left and right uses blue for the device outline, medium gray in the screen area, and light gray for the radio wave lines. Lastly, the PC symbol uses blue for the device outline and the onscreen sad face and horizontal lines and medium gray in the screen background.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5ea6a976464ec36e5dbdbf30588a25e0/sf-palette%402x.png)

**Multicolor** — Applies intrinsic colors to some symbols to enhance meaning. For example, the `leaf` symbol uses green to reflect the appearance of leaves in the physical world, whereas the `trash.slash` symbol uses red to signal data loss. Some multicolor symbols include layers that can receive other colors.

![A diagram showing a row of eight symbols, using combinations of various colors. From the left, the square and arrow up symbol uses blue for all lines. Next, folder badge plus uses green for the badge and blue for the folder. Trash slash uses red for both the slash and the can. Calendar day timeline right uses red for the horizontal indicator, dark gray for the square, and light gray for the dots. List number uses black for the column of numbers and medium gray for the horizontal lines. Text format A B C dotted underline uses red for the dots under the black letters. iPhone radio waves left and right uses blue for all lines. Lastly, the PC symbol uses yellow for the device outline, white for the onscreen sad face and horizontal lines, and blue in the screen background.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/82097ab3d98f098d12935ab4d6c1c896/sf-multicolor%402x.png)

Regardless of rendering mode, using system-provided colors ensures that symbols automatically adapt to accessibility accommodations and appearance modes like vibrancy and Dark Mode. For developer guidance, see [renderingMode(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/image/renderingmode(_:)).

**Confirm that a symbol’s rendering mode works well in every context.** Depending on factors like the size of a symbol and its contrast with the current background color, different rendering modes can affect how well people can discern the symbol’s details. You can use the automatic setting to get a symbol’s preferred rendering mode, but it’s still a good idea to check the results for places where a different rendering mode might improve a symbol’s legibility.

## [Gradients](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols\#Gradients)

In SF Symbols 7 and later, gradient rendering generates a smooth linear gradient from a single source color. You can use gradients across all rendering modes for both system and custom colors and for custom symbols. Gradients render for symbols of any size, but look best at larger sizes.

![The sun symbol with a solid yellow fill.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/2df52fad04d6250f02143138ff76da14/sf-symbols-sun-solid-fill%402x.png)Solid fill

![The sun symbol with a gradient fill derived from a single yellow source color. The gradient color is bright on the left edge of the symbol, and subtly darkens as it approaches the right edge.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/18a48b9b3b9f3842ff42f1331edeb5fb/sf-symbols-sun-gradient-fill%402x.png)Gradient fill

## [Variable color](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols\#Variable-color)

With variable color, you can represent a characteristic that can change over time — like capacity or strength — regardless of rendering mode. To visually communicate such a change, variable color applies color to different layers of a symbol as a value reaches different thresholds between zero and 100 percent.

For example, you could use variable color with the `speaker.wave.3` symbol to communicate three different ranges of sound — plus the state where there’s no sound — by mapping the layers that represent the curved wave paths to different ranges of decibel values. In the case of no sound, no wave layers get color. In all other cases, a wave layer receives color when the sound reaches a threshold the system defines based on the number of nonzero states you want to represent.

![A diagram showing four versions of the speaker wave three symbol, each of which displays color in a different number of wave paths. From the left, the number of waves with color is zero, one, two, and three.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/e03af602ef484d26ff5cc3428e98079a/sf-variable-color%402x.png)

Sometimes, it can make sense for some of a symbol’s layers to opt out of variable color. For example, in the `speaker.wave.3` symbol shown above, the layer that contains the speaker path doesn’t receive variable color because a speaker doesn’t change as the sound level changes. A symbol can support variable color in any number of layers.

**Use variable color to communicate change — don’t use it to communicate depth.** To convey depth and visual hierarchy, use Hierarchical rendering mode to elevate certain layers and distinguish foreground and background elements in a symbol.

## [Weights and scales](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols\#Weights-and-scales)

SF Symbols provides symbols in a wide range of weights and scales to help you create adaptable designs.

![A diagram showing the square and arrow up symbol in all 27 weights and scales.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/a46e2c294c605c4f5e5f626c67d6bb2d/sf-scales-weights%402x.png)

Each of the nine symbol weights — from ultralight to black — corresponds to a weight of the San Francisco system font, helping you achieve precise weight matching between symbols and adjacent text, while supporting flexibility for different sizes and contexts.

Each symbol is also available in three scales: small, medium (the default), and large. The scales are defined relative to the cap height of the San Francisco system font.

![A diagram showing the first of three images of the plus circle symbol followed by the capitalized word add. In each image, the word uses the same size, but the symbol uses a different size. The symbol size is small in this image. Two parallel horizontal lines appear across all three images. The top line shows the height of the capital letter A and the bottom line is the baseline under the word add. In this small symbol, the circle touches both lines.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/bf6a6d81c531a772bbe9c768af32f0b8/sf-symbol-scale-small%402x.png)Small

![The second of three images of the plus circle symbol followed by the capitalized word add. In this medium symbol, the circle extends slightly above and below the lines.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/aa672f59358a8bb354e4ea9e7d258467/sf-symbol-scale-medium%402x.png)Medium

![The third of three images of the plus circle symbol followed by the capitalized word add. In this large symbol, the vertical line of the plus sign almost touches both lines.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/6696a9dbf59f8ef7118ac712067de2e6/sf-symbol-scale-large%402x.png)Large

Specifying a scale lets you adjust a symbol’s emphasis compared to adjacent text, without disrupting the weight matching with text that uses the same point size. For developer guidance, see [`imageScale(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/imageScale(_:)) (SwiftUI), [`UIImage.SymbolScale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIImage/SymbolScale) (UIKit), and [`NSImage.SymbolConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSImage/SymbolConfiguration-swift.class) (AppKit).

## [Design variants](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols\#Design-variants)

SF Symbols defines several design variants — such as fill, slash, and enclosed — that can help you communicate precise states and actions while maintaining visual consistency and simplicity in your UI. For example, you could use the slash variant of a symbol to show that an item or action is unavailable, or use the fill variant to indicate selection.

Outline is the most common variant in SF Symbols. An outlined symbol has no solid areas, resembling the appearance of text. Most symbols are also available in a fill variant, in which the areas within some shapes are solid.

In addition to outline and fill, SF Symbols also defines variants that include a slash or enclose a symbol within a shape like a circle, square, or rectangle. In many cases, enclosed and slash variants can combine with outline or fill variants.

![A diagram showing two rows of the same five symbols. In the top row, every symbol uses the outline variant; the bottom row shows the fill variant of each symbol. From the left, the symbols are heart, heart slash, heart circle, heart square, and a heart in a rectangle.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/c4486c6d1dc36ea164665276e912139a/sf-variants%402x.png)

SF Symbols provides many variants for specific languages and writing systems, including Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Cyrillic, Devanagari, and several Indic numeral systems. Language- and script-specific variants adapt automatically when the device language changes. For guidance, see [Images](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left#Images).

![A diagram with eight rows of the same twelve symbols, where each row shows a localized version of the symbol. From the left the symbols are doc rich text, doc rich text fill, character book closed, character book closed fill, character bubble, character bubble fill, character, text format superscript, text format subscript, text format size, character text box, and character cursor I beam.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/cf9d526c8f3a39b600f0226125a2b228/sf-localized%402x.png)

Symbol variants support a range of design goals. For example:

- The outline variant works well in toolbars, lists, and other places where you display a symbol alongside text.

- Symbols that use an enclosing shape — like a square or circle — can improve legibility at small sizes.

- The solid areas in a fill variant tend to give a symbol more visual emphasis, making it a good choice for iOS tab bars and swipe actions and places where you use an accent color to communicate selection.

In many cases, the view that displays a symbol determines whether to use outline or fill, so you don’t have to specify a variant. For example, an iOS tab bar prefers the fill variant, whereas a toolbar takes the outline variant.

## [Animations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols\#Animations)

SF Symbols provides a collection of expressive, configurable animations that enhance your interface and add vitality to your app. Symbol animations help communicate ideas, provide feedback in response to people’s actions, and signal changes in status or ongoing activities.

Animations work on all SF Symbols in the library, in all rendering modes, weights, and scales, and on custom symbols. For considerations when animating custom symbols, see [Custom symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#Custom-symbols). You can control the playback of an animation, whether you want the animation to run from start to finish, or run indefinitely, repeating its effect until a condition is met. You can customize behaviors, like changing the playback speed of an animation or determining whether to reverse an animation before repeating it. For developer guidance, see [Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Symbols) and [`SymbolEffect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Symbols/SymbolEffect).

**Appear** — Causes a symbol to gradually emerge into view.

Content description: A video showing three symbols with the same appear animation effect applied to each. In each animation, the symbol layers gradually animate into view. From the left, the symbols are an antenna with radio waves that animate from the center outward, a photo stack with lines representing a stack animating from the bottom to the top, and a waveform animating from left to right.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#)

**Disappear** — Causes a symbol to gradually recede out of view.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: A video showing three symbols with the same disappear animation effect applied to each. In each animation, all the symbol layers gradually animate out of view. From the left, the symbols are a folder with a badge plus icon, two overlapping lightbulbs, and two overlapping chat bubbles

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#)

**Bounce** — Briefly scales a symbol with an elastic-like movement that goes either up or down and then returns to the symbol’s initial state. The bounce animation plays once by default and can help communicate that an action occurred or needs to take place.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: A video showing three symbols with the same bounce animation effect applied to each. In each animation, the symbol layers individually bounce. From the left, the symbols are a music note with three lines, text that reads haha, and the Live Photos icon.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#)

**Scale** — Changes the size of a symbol, increasing or decreasing its scale. Unlike the bounce animation, which returns the symbol to its original state, the scale animation persists until you set a new scale or remove the effect. You might use the scale animation to draw people’s attention to a selected item or as feedback when people choose a symbol.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: A video showing three symbols with the same scale animation effect applied to each. In each animation, the symbol decreases in size, and after a pause, increases back to the original size. From the left, the symbols are a PIP exit window, a 3D stack of three diagonally positioned squares, and an overlapping HomePod and HomePod mini.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#)

**Pulse** — Varies the opacity of a symbol over time. This animation automatically pulses only the layers within a symbol that are annotated to pulse, and optionally can pulse all layers within a symbol. You might use the pulse animation to communicate ongoing activity, playing it continuously until a condition is met.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: A video showing three symbols with the same pulse animation effect applied to each. In each animation, one layer pulses its opacity. From the left, the symbols are the AirPlay icon with a pulsing screen, a chat bubble with a waveform that is overlapped with a pulsing pause button, and a pulsing rectangle to represent a screen that is overlapped with a person icon.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#)

**Variable color** — Incrementally varies the opacity of layers within a symbol. This animation can be cumulative or iterative. When cumulative, color changes persist for each layer until the animation cycle is complete. When iterative, color changes occur one layer at a time. You might use variable color to communicate progress or ongoing activity, such as playback, connecting, or broadcasting. You can customize the animation to autoreverse — meaning reverse the animation to the starting point and replay the sequence — as well as hide inactive layers rather than reduce their opacity.

The arrangement of layers within a symbol determines how variable color behaves during a repeating animation. Symbols with layers that are arranged linearly where the start and end points don’t meet are annotated as _open loop_. Symbols with layers that follow a complete shape where the start and end points do meet, like in a circular progress indicator, are annotated as _closed loop_. Variable color animations for symbols with closed loop designs feature seamless, continuous playback.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: A video showing three symbols with the same variable color animation effect applied to each. In each animation, color is added one path at a time. From the left, the symbols are a speaker with color cycling through three sound waves, a Wi-Fi symbol with color cycling through two paths that represent signal strength before reversing and replaying the animation, and a sprinkler icon with color cycling through droplets.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#)

**Replace** — Replaces one symbol with another. The replace animation works between arbitrary symbols and across all weights and rendering modes. This animation features three configurations:

- Down-up, where the outgoing symbol scales down and the incoming symbol scales up, communicating a change in state.

- Up-up, where both the outgoing and incoming symbols scale up. This configuration communicates a change in state that includes a sense of forward progression.

- Off-up, where the outgoing symbol hides immediately and the incoming symbol scales up. This configuration communicates a state change that emphasizes the next available state or action.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: A video showing three symbols with the same replace animation effect applied to each. In each animation, one symbol is replaced by a new symbol, and then replaced by the original symbol. From the left, the symbols are a grid of four squares replaced by a bulleted list, a cloud with rain replaced by a cloud partly blocking the sun, and microphone symbol replaced by an x symbol in a circle.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#)

From left to right: down-up, up-up, off-up

**Magic Replace** — Performs a smart transition between two symbols with related shapes. For example, slashes can draw on and off, and badges can appear or disappear, or you can replace them independently of the base symbol. Magic Replace is the new default replace animation, but doesn’t occur between unrelated symbols; the default down-up animation occurs instead. You can choose a custom direction for the fallback animation in these situations if you prefer one other than the default.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: A video showing three symbols each with a shape being added, removed, or replaced using the Magic Replace animation effect. In each animation, the symbol is transformed, and then the transformation is reverted. From the left, the symbols are a credit card with a triangle caution shape added, a microphone with a diagonal slash added, and a circular ID with a checkmark badge replaced by an X badge.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#)

**Wiggle** — Moves the symbol back and forth along a directional axis. You might use the wiggle animation to highlight a change or a call to action that a person might overlook. Wiggle can also add a dynamic emphasis to an interaction or reinforce what the symbol is representing, such as when an arrow points in a specific direction.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: A video showing three symbols that wiggle laterally, rotationally, or along a linear axis. From the left, the symbols are an arrow pointing down at a container that wiggles vertically; a stack of two photos that wiggles rotationally; and a top-down car between two lane markers with arrows pointing inward that wiggles horizontally.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#)

**Breathe** — Smoothly increases and decreases the presence of a symbol, giving it a living quality. You might use the breathe animation to convey status changes, or signal that an activity is taking place, like an ongoing recording session. Breathe is similar to pulse; however pulse animates by changing opacity alone, while breathe changes both opacity and size to convey ongoing activity.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: A video showing three symbols that breathe in and out, growing and shrinking in size and changing opacity in a smooth rhythm. From the left, the symbols are a stylized waveform of vertical lines that expand and contract from left to right with a pulse of variable opacity; a pair of translation word bubbles that grow with reduced opacity, then shrink with increased opacity; and three concentric mindfulness rings that pulse outward with reduced opacity, then inward with increased opacity.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#)

**Rotate** — Rotates the symbol to act as a visual indicator or imitate an object’s behavior in the real world. For example, when a task is in progress, rotation confirms that it’s working as expected. The rotate animation causes some symbols to rotate entirely, while in others only certain parts of the symbol rotate. Symbols like the desk fan, for example, use the By Layer rotation option to spin only the fan blades.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: A video showing three symbols that either rotate completely or contain a rotating shape. From the left, the symbols are a rotating gear; a desk fan with rotating fan blades; and two dots rotating on concentric orbital paths around a center circle.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#)

**Draw On / Draw Off** — In SF Symbols 7 and later, draws the symbol along a path through a set of guide points, either from offscreen to onscreen (Draw On) or from onscreen to offscreen (Draw Off). You can draw all layers at once, stagger them, or draw each layer one at a time. You might use the draw animation to convey progress, as with a download, or to reinforce the meaning of a symbol, like a directional arrow.

**Apply symbol animations judiciously.** While there’s no limit to how many animations you can add to a view, too many animations can overwhelm an interface and distract people.

**Make sure that animations serve a clear purpose in communicating a symbol’s intent.** Each type of animation has a discrete movement that communicates a certain type of action or elicits a certain response. Consider how people might interpret an animated symbol and whether the animation, or combination of animations, might be confusing.

**Use symbol animations to communicate information more efficiently.** Animations provide visual feedback, reinforcing that something happened in your interface. You can use animations to present complex information in a simple way and without taking up a lot of visual space.

**Consider your app’s tone when adding animations.** When animating a symbol, think about what the animation can convey and how that might align with your brand identity and your app’s overall style and tone. For guidance, see [Branding](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/branding).

## [Custom symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols\#Custom-symbols)

If you need a symbol that SF Symbols doesn’t provide, you can create your own. To create a custom symbol, first export the template for a symbol that’s similar to the design you want, then use a vector-editing tool to modify it. For developer guidance, see [Creating custom symbol images for your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/creating-custom-symbol-images-for-your-app).

Using a process called _annotating_, you can assign a specific color — or a specific hierarchical level, such as primary, secondary, or tertiary — to each layer in a custom symbol. Depending on the rendering modes you support, you can use a different mode in each instance of the symbol in your app.

**Use the template as a guide.** Create a custom symbol that’s consistent with the ones the system provides in level of detail, optical weight, alignment, position, and perspective. Strive to design a symbol that is:

- Simple

- Recognizable

- Inclusive

- Directly related to the action or content it represents

For guidance, see [Icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons).

**Assign negative side margins to your custom symbol if necessary.** SF Symbols supports negative side margins to aid optical horizontal alignment when a symbol contains a badge or other elements that increase its width. For example, negative side margins can help you horizontally align a stack of folder symbols, some of which include a badge. The name of each margin includes the relevant configuration — such as “left-margin-Regular-M” — so be sure to use this naming pattern if you add margins to your custom symbols.

**Optimize layers to use animations with custom symbols.** If you want to animate your symbol by layer, make sure to annotate the layers in the SF Symbols app. The Z-order determines the order that you want to apply colors to the layers of a variable color symbol, and you can choose whether to animate those changes from front-to-back, or back-to-front. You can also animate by layer groups to have related layers move together.

**Test animations for custom symbols.** It’s important to test your custom symbols with all of the animation presets because the shapes and paths might not appear how you expect when the layers are in motion. To get the most out of this feature, consider drawing your custom symbols with whole shapes. For example, a custom symbol similar to the `person.2.fill` symbol doesn’t need to create a cutout for the shape representing the person on the left. Instead, you can draw the full shape of the person, and in addition to that, draw an offset path of the person on the right to help represent the gap between them. You can later annotate this offset path as an erase layer to render the symbol as you want. This method of drawing helps preserve additional layer information that allows for animations to perform as you expect.

**Avoid making custom symbols that include common variants, such as enclosures or badges.** The SF Symbols app offers a component library for creating variants of your custom symbol. Using the component library allows you to create commonly used variants of your custom symbol while maintaining design consistency with the included SF Symbols.

**Provide alternative text labels for custom symbols.** Alternative text labels — or accessibility descriptions — let VoiceOver describe visible UI and content, making navigation easier for people with visual disabilities. For guidance, see [VoiceOver](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/voiceover).

**Don’t design replicas of Apple products.** Apple products are copyrighted and you can’t reproduce them in your custom symbols. Also, you can’t customize a symbol that SF Symbols identifies as representing an Apple feature or product.

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols\#Platform-considerations)

# Images

To make sure your artwork looks great on all devices you support, learn how the system displays content and how to deliver art at the appropriate scale factors.

![A sketch of a photo, suggesting imagery. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/b0a68ac859ddb098858e92609997d307/foundations-images-intro%402x.png)

## [Resolution](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images\#Resolution)

Different devices can display images at different resolutions. For example, a 2D device displays images according to the resolution of its screen.

A _point_ is an abstract unit of measurement that helps visual content remain consistent regardless of how it’s displayed. In 2D platforms, a point maps to a number of pixels that can vary according to the resolution of the display; in visionOS, a point is an angular value that allows visual content to scale according to its distance from the viewer.

When creating bitmap images, you specify a _scale factor_ which determines the resolution of an image. You can visualize scale factor by considering the density of pixels per point in 2D displays of various resolutions. For example, a scale factor of 1 (also called @1x) describes a 1:1 pixel density, where one pixel is equal to one point. High-resolution 2D displays have higher pixel densities, such as 2:1 or 3:1. A 2:1 density (called @2x) has a scale factor of 2, and a 3:1 density (called @3x) has a scale factor of 3. Because of higher pixel densities, high-resolution displays demand images with more pixels.

![Image of a circle that's in standard resolution at scale factor of @1x, and is 10 by 10 pixels.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/a9b04545f30aff45ca503e263c02d464/image-resolution-1x%402x.png)1x (10x10 px)

![Image of a circle that's in high resolution at a scale factor of @2x, and is 20 by 20 pixels.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/cf203acc0ee6299833fb2e5b5c4a7348/image-resolution-2x%402x.png)2x (20x20 px)

![Image of a circle that's in high resolution at a scale factor of @3x, and is 30 by 30 pixels.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/0de9ee5144fc2278682eb211ac8f571d/image-resolution-3x%402x.png)3x (30x30 px)

**Provide high-resolution assets for all bitmap images in your app, for every device you support.** As you add each image to your project’s asset catalog, identify its scale factor by appending “@1x,” “@2x,” or “@3x” to its filename. Use the following values for guidance; for additional scale factors, see [Layout](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout).

| Platform | Scale factors |
| --- | --- |
| iPadOS, watchOS | @2x |
| iOS | @2x and @3x |
| visionOS | @2x or higher (see [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images#visionOS)) |
| macOS, tvOS | @1x and @2x |

**In general, design images at the lowest resolution and scale them up to create high-resolution assets.** When you use resizable vectorized shapes, you might want to position control points at whole values so that they’re cleanly aligned at 1x. This positioning allows the points to remain cleanly aligned to the raster grid at higher resolutions, because 2x and 3x are multiples of 1x.

## [Formats](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images\#Formats)

As you create different types of images, consider the following recommendations.

| Image type | Format |
| --- | --- |
| Bitmap or raster work | De-interlaced PNG files |
| PNG graphics that don’t require full 24-bit color | An 8-bit color palette |
| Photos | JPEG files, optimized as necessary, or HEIC files |
| Stereo or spatial photos | Stereo HEIC |
| Flat icons, interface icons, and other flat artwork that requires high-resolution scaling | PDF or SVG files |

## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images\#Best-practices)

**Include a color profile with each image.** Color profiles help ensure that your app’s colors appear as intended on different displays. For guidance, see [Color management](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color#Color-management).

**Always test images on a range of actual devices.** An image that looks great at design time may appear pixelated, stretched, or compressed when viewed on various devices.

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images\#Platform-considerations)

_No additional considerations for iOS, iPadOS, or macOS._

### [tvOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images\#tvOS)

Layered images are at the heart of the Apple TV user experience. The system combines layered images, transparency, scaling, and motion to produce a sense of realism and vigor that evokes a personal connection as people interact with onscreen content.

#### [Parallax effect](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images\#Parallax-effect)

_Parallax_ is a subtle visual effect the system uses to convey depth and dynamism when an element is in focus. As an element comes into focus, the system elevates it to the foreground, gently swaying it while applying illumination that makes the element’s surface appear to shine. After a period of inactivity, out-of-focus content dims and the focused element expands.

Layered images are required to support the parallax effect.

#### [Layered images](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images\#Layered-images)

A _layered image_ consists of two to five distinct layers that come together to form a single image. The separation between layers, along with use of transparency, creates a feeling of depth. As someone interacts with an image, layers closer to the surface elevate and scale, overlapping lower layers farther back and producing a 3D effect.

You can embed layered images in your app or retrieve them from a content server at runtime. For guidance on adding layered images to your app, see the [Parallax Previewer User Guide](https://help.apple.com/itc/parallaxpreviewer/).

**Use standard interface elements to display layered images.** If you use standard views and system-provided focus APIs — such as [`FocusState`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/FocusState) — layered images automatically get the parallax treatment when people bring them into focus.

**Identify logical foreground, middle, and background elements.** In foreground layers, display prominent elements like a character in a game, or text on an album cover or movie poster. Middle layers are perfect for secondary content and effects like shadows. Background layers are opaque backdrops that showcase the foreground and middle layers without upstaging them.

**Generally, keep text in the foreground.** Unless you want to obscure text, bring it to the foreground layer for clarity.

**Keep the background layer opaque.** Using varying levels of opacity to let content shine through higher layers is fine, but your background layer must be opaque — you’ll get an error if it’s not. An opaque background layer ensures your artwork looks great with parallax, drop shadows, and system backgrounds.

**Keep layering simple and subtle.** Parallax is designed to be almost unnoticeable. Excessive 3D effects can appear unrealistic and jarring. Keep depth simple to bring your content to life and add delight.

**Leave a safe zone around the foreground layers of your image.** When focused, content on some layers may be cropped as the layered image scales and moves. To ensure that essential content is always visible, keep it within a safe zone. For guidance, see [App icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons).

**Always preview layered images.** To ensure your layered images look great on Apple TV, preview them throughout your design process using Xcode, the Parallax Previewer app for macOS, or the Parallax Exporter plug-in for Adobe Photoshop. Pay special attention as scaling and clipping occur, and readjust your images as needed to keep important content safe. After your layered images are final, preview them on an actual TV for the most accurate representation of what people will see. To download Parallax Previewer and Parallax Exporter, see [Resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/#parallax-previewer).

### [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images\#visionOS)

In visionOS, people can view images at a much larger range of sizes than in any other platform, and the system dynamically scales the image resolution to match the current size. Because you can position images at specific angles within someone’s surroundings, image pixels may not line up 1:1 with screen pixels.

**Create a layered app icon.** App icons in visionOS are composed of two to three layers that provide the appearance of depth by moving at subtly different rates when the icon is in focus. For guidance, see [Layer design](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons#Layer-design).

**Prefer vector-based art for 2D images.** Avoid bitmap content because it might not look good when the system scales it up. If you use Core Animation layers, see [Drawing sharp layer-based content in visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/drawing-sharp-layer-based-content) for developer guidance.

**If you need to use rasterized images, balance quality with performance as you choose a resolution.** Although a @2x image looks fine at common viewing distances, its fixed resolution means that the system doesn’t dynamically scale it and it might not look sharp from close up. To help a rasterized image look sharp when people view it from a wide range of distances, you can use a higher resolution, but each increase in resolution results in a larger file size and may impact your app’s runtime performance, especially for resolutions over @6x. If you use images that have resolutions higher than @2x, be sure to also apply high-quality image filtering to help balance quality and performance (for developer guidance, see [`filters`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CALayer/filters)).

#### [Spatial photos and spatial scenes](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images\#Spatial-photos-and-spatial-scenes)

In addition to 2D and stereoscopic images, visionOS apps and games can use RealityKit to display spatial photos and spatial scenes. A _spatial photo_ is a stereoscopic photo with additional spatial metadata, as captured on iPhone 15 Pro or later, Apple Vision Pro, or other compatible camera. A _spatial scene_ is a 3D image generated from a 2D image to add a parallax effect that responds to head movement. For developer guidance, see [`ImagePresentationComponent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/ImagePresentationComponent).

**Make sure spatial photos render correctly in your app.** Use the stereo High-Efficiency Image Codec (HEIC) format to display a spatial photo in your app. When you add spatial metadata to a stereo HEIC, visionOS recognizes the photo as spatial and includes visual treatments that help minimize common causes of stereo-viewing discomfort.

**Prefer the feathered glass background effect to display text over spatial photos.** If you need to place text over a spatial photo in your app or game, use the feathered glass background effect. The effect adds contrast to make the text readable, and it blurs out detail to help reduce visual discomfort when people view text over spatial photos. For developer guidance, see [`GlassBackgroundEffect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/GlassBackgroundEffect).

**Take visual comfort into consideration when you make spatial photos from existing 2D content.** When adjusting the spatial metadata of a photo for your app or game, consider how you want people to view your content. Metadata like disparity adjustment can alter how people perceive the 3D scene, and can cause visual discomfort from certain viewing positions. For developer guidance, see [Creating spatial photos and videos with spatial metadata](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ImageIO/Creating-spatial-photos-and-videos-with-spatial-metadata).

**Display spatial photos and spatial scenes in standalone views.** Avoid displaying spatial photos inline with other content, as this can cause visual discomfort. Instead, showcase spatial photos or spatial scenes in a separate view, like a sheet or window. If you must display stereoscopic images inline, provide generous spacing between the image and any inline content to help people’s eyes adjust to the depth changes.

**Use spatial scenes in your app for specific moments.** Each spatial scene can take up to several seconds to generate from an existing image. Design experiences with this limitation in mind. For instance, the Photos app offers an explicit action to create a spatial scene while immersed in a single photo. Avoid displaying too many spatial scenes at once. Instead, use scroll views, pagination, or explicit actions to move to new photos and keep the visual information hierarchy simple.

**When displaying immersively, prefer minimal UI.** For example, the Spatial Gallery app displays a single piece of content with a small caption and a single Back button, relying on swipe gestures to navigate between items.

**Prefer displaying larger spatial scenes that you center in someone’s field of view.** When people view a spatial scene, they may move their head laterally to view the parallax effect. Smaller spatial scenes provide less of a parallax effect and may not be as impactful to viewers.

### [watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images\#watchOS)

**In general, avoid transparency to keep image files small.** If you always composite an image on the same solid background color, it’s more efficient to include the background in the image. However, transparency is necessary in complication images, menu icons, and other interface icons that serve as template images, because the system uses it to determine where to apply color.

**Use autoscaling PDFs to let you provide a single asset for all screen sizes.** Design your image for the 40mm and 42mm screens at 2x. When you load the PDF, WatchKit automatically scales the image based on the device’s screen size, using the values shown below:

| Screen size | Image scale |
| --- | --- |
| 38mm | 90% |
| 40mm | 100% |
| 41mm | 106% |
| 42mm | 100% |
| 44mm | 110% |
| 45mm | 119% |
| 49mm | 119% |

# Layout

A consistent layout that adapts to various contexts makes your experience more approachable and helps people enjoy their favorite apps and games on all their devices.

![A sketch of a small rectangle in the upper-left quadrant of a larger rectangle, suggesting the position of a user interface element within a window. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/fe3e14f290a6986d2490634a9e2fab0c/foundations-layout-intro%402x.png)

Your app’s layout helps ground people in your content from the moment they open it. People expect familiar relationships between controls and content to help them use and discover your app’s features, and designing the layout to take advantage of this makes your app feel at home on the platform.

Apple provides templates, guides, and other resources that can help you integrate Apple technologies and design your apps and games to run on all Apple platforms. See [Apple Design Resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/).

## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#Best-practices)

**Group related items to help people find the information they want.** For example, you might use negative space, background shapes, colors, materials, or separator lines to show when elements are related and to separate information into distinct areas. When you do so, ensure that content and controls remain clearly distinct.

**Make essential information easy to find by giving it sufficient space.** People want to view the most important information right away, so don’t obscure it by crowding it with nonessential details. You can make secondary information available in other parts of the window, or include it in an additional view.

**Extend content to fill the screen or window.** Make sure backgrounds and full-screen artwork extend to the edges of the display. Also ensure that scrollable layouts continue all the way to the bottom and the sides of the device screen. Controls and navigation components like sidebars and tab bars appear on top of content rather than on the same plane, so it’s important for your layout to take this into account.

When your content doesn’t span the full window, use a background extension view to provide the appearance of content behind the control layer on either side of the screen, such as beneath the sidebar or inspector. For developer guidance, see [`backgroundExtensionEffect()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/backgroundExtensionEffect()) and [`UIBackgroundExtensionView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIBackgroundExtensionView).

![A screenshot of a full screen iPad app with a sidebar on the leading edge. A photo of Mount Fuji fills the top half of the content area. The photo subtly blurs as it reaches the top of the screen, where toolbar items float above it grouped on the trailing edge. Where the photo meets the sidebar, the image flips, blurs, and extends fully beneath the sidebar to the edge of the screen.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/ffacfee843cc378d0af09d8926f2408b/layout-background-extention-view%402x.png)

## [Visual hierarchy](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#Visual-hierarchy)

**Differentiate controls from content.** Take advantage of the Liquid Glass material to provide a distinct appearance for controls that’s consistent across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Instead of a background, use a scroll edge effect to provide a transition between content and the control area. For guidance, see [Scroll views](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/scroll-views).

**Place items to convey their relative importance.** People often start by viewing items in reading order — that is, from top to bottom and from the leading to trailing side — so it generally works well to place the most important items near the top and leading side of the window, display, or [field of view](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout#Field-of-view). Be aware that reading order varies by language, and take [right to left](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left) languages into account as you design.

**Align components with one another to make them easier to scan and to communicate organization and hierarchy.** Alignment makes an app look neat and organized and can help people track content while scrolling or moving their eyes, making it easier to find information. Along with indentation, alignment can also help people understand an information hierarchy.

**Take advantage of progressive disclosure to help people discover content that’s currently hidden.** For example, if you can’t display all the items in a large collection at once, you need to indicate that there are additional items that aren’t currently visible. Depending on the platform, you might use a [disclosure control](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/disclosure-controls), or display parts of items to hint that people can reveal additional content by interacting with the view, such as by scrolling.

**Make controls easier to use by providing enough space around them and grouping them in logical sections.** If unrelated controls are too close together — or if other content crowds them — they can be difficult for people to tell apart or understand what they do, which can make your app or game hard to use. For guidance, see [Toolbars](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/toolbars).

## [Adaptability](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#Adaptability)

Every app and game needs to adapt when the device or system context changes. In iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and visionOS, the system defines a collection of _traits_ that characterize variations in the device environment that can affect the way your app or game looks. Using SwiftUI or Auto Layout can help you ensure that your interface adapts dynamically to these traits and other context changes; if you don’t use these tools, you need to use alternative methods to do the work.

Here are some of the most common device and system variations you need to handle:

- Different device screen sizes, resolutions, and color spaces

- Different device orientations (portrait/landscape)

- System features like Dynamic Island and camera controls

- External display support, Display Zoom, and resizable windows on iPad

- Dynamic Type text-size changes

- Locale-based internationalization features like left-to-right/right-to-left layout direction, date/time/number formatting, font variation, and text length

**Design a layout that adapts gracefully to context changes while remaining recognizably consistent.** People expect your experience to work well and remain familiar when they rotate their device, resize a window, add another display, or switch to a different device. You can help ensure an adaptable interface by respecting system-defined safe areas, margins, and guides (where available) and specifying layout modifiers to fine-tune the placement of views in your interface.

**Be prepared for text-size changes.** People appreciate apps and games that respond when they choose a different text size. When you support [Dynamic Type](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography#Supporting-Dynamic-Type) — a feature that lets people choose the size of visible text in iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS — your app or game can respond appropriately when people adjust text size. To support Dynamic Type in your Unity-based game, use Apple’s accessibility plug-in (for developer guidance, see [Apple – Accessibility](https://github.com/apple/unityplugins/blob/main/plug-ins/Apple.Accessibility/Apple.Accessibility_Unity/Assets/Apple.Accessibility/Documentation~/Apple.Accessibility.md)). For guidance on displaying text in your app, see [Typography](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography).

**Preview your app on multiple devices, using different orientations, localizations, and text sizes.** You can streamline the testing process by first testing versions of your experience that use the largest and the smallest layouts. Although it’s generally best to preview features like wide-gamut color on actual devices, you can use Xcode Simulator to check for clipping and other layout issues. For example, if your iOS app or game supports landscape mode, you can use Simulator to make sure your layouts look great whether the device rotates left or right.

**When necessary, scale artwork in response to display changes.** For example, viewing your app or game in a different context — such as on a screen with a different aspect ratio — might make your artwork appear cropped, letterboxed, or pillarboxed. If this happens, don’t change the aspect ratio of the artwork; instead, scale it so that important visual content remains visible. In visionOS, the system automatically [scales](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout#Scale) a window when it moves along the z-axis.

## [Guides and safe areas](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#Guides-and-safe-areas)

A _layout guide_ defines a rectangular region that helps you position, align, and space your content on the screen. The system includes predefined layout guides that make it easy to apply standard margins around content and restrict the width of text for optimal readability. You can also define custom layout guides. For developer guidance, see [`UILayoutGuide`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UILayoutGuide) and [`NSLayoutGuide`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSLayoutGuide).

A _safe area_ defines the area within a view that isn’t covered by a toolbar, tab bar, or other views a window might provide. Safe areas are essential for avoiding a device’s interactive and display features, like Dynamic Island on iPhone or the camera housing on some Mac models. For developer guidance, see [`SafeAreaRegions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/SafeAreaRegions) and [Positioning content relative to the safe area](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/positioning-content-relative-to-the-safe-area).

**Respect key display and system features in each platform.** When an app or game doesn’t accommodate such features, it doesn’t feel at home in the platform and may be harder for people to use. In addition to helping you avoid display and system features, safe areas can also help you account for interactive components like bars, dynamically repositioning content when sizes change.

For templates that include the guides and safe areas for each platform, see [Apple Design Resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/).

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#Platform-considerations)

### [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#iOS)

**Aim to support both portrait and landscape orientations.** People appreciate apps and games that work well in different device orientations, but sometimes your experience needs to run in only portrait or only landscape. When this is the case, you can rely on people trying both orientations before settling on the one you support — there’s no need to tell people to rotate their device. If your app or game is landscape-only, make sure it runs equally well whether people rotate their device to the left or the right.

**Prefer a full-bleed interface for your game.** Give players a beautiful interface that fills the screen while accommodating the corner radius, sensor housing, and features like Dynamic Island. If necessary, consider giving players the option to view your game using a letterboxed or pillarboxed appearance.

**Avoid full-width buttons.** Buttons feel at home in iOS when they respect system-defined margins and are inset from the edges of the screen. If you need to include a full-width button, make sure it harmonizes with the curvature of the hardware and aligns with adjacent safe areas.

**Hide the status bar only when it adds value or enhances your experience.** The status bar displays information people find useful and it occupies an area of the screen most apps don’t fully use, so it’s generally a good idea to keep it visible. The exception is if you offer an in-depth experience like playing a game or viewing media, where it might make sense to hide the status bar.

### [iPadOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#iPadOS)

People can freely resize windows down to a minimum width and height, similar to window behavior in macOS. It’s important to account for this resizing behavior and the full range of possible window sizes when designing your layout. For guidance, see [Multitasking](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/multitasking#iPadOS) and [Windows](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/windows#iPadOS).

**As someone resizes a window, defer switching to a compact view for as long as possible.** Design for a full-screen view first, and only switch to a compact view when a version of the full layout no longer fits. This helps the UI feel more stable and familiar in as many situations as possible. For more complex layouts such as [split views](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/split-views), prefer hiding tertiary columns such as inspectors as the view narrows.

**Test your layout at common system-provided sizes, and provide smooth transitions.** Window controls provide the option to arrange windows to fill halves, thirds, and quadrants of the screen, so it’s important to check your layout at each of these sizes on a variety of devices. Be sure to minimize unexpected UI changes as people adjust down to the minimum and up to the maximum window size.

**Consider a convertible tab bar for adaptive navigation.** For many apps, you don’t need to choose between a tab bar or sidebar for navigation; instead, you can adopt a style of tab bar that provides both. The app first launches with your choice of a sidebar or a tab bar, and then people can tap to switch between them. As the view resizes, the presentation style changes to fit the width of the view. For guidance, see [Tab bars](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/tab-bars). For developer guidance, see [`sidebarAdaptable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/TabViewStyle/sidebarAdaptable).

### [macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#macOS)

**Avoid placing controls or critical information at the bottom of a window.** People often move windows so that the bottom edge is below the bottom of the screen.

**Avoid displaying content within the camera housing at the top edge of the window.** For developer guidance, see [`NSPrefersDisplaySafeAreaCompatibilityMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/NSPrefersDisplaySafeAreaCompatibilityMode).

### [tvOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#tvOS)

**Be prepared for a wide range of TV sizes.** On Apple TV, layouts don’t automatically adapt to the size of the screen like they do on iPhone or iPad. Instead, apps and games show the same interface on every display. Take extra care in designing your layout so that it looks great in a variety of screen sizes.

**Adhere to the screen’s safe area.** Inset primary content 60 points from the top and bottom of the screen, and 80 points from the sides. It can be difficult for people to see content that close to the edges, and unintended cropping can occur due to overscanning on older TVs. Allow only partially displayed offscreen content and elements that deliberately flow offscreen to appear outside this zone.

![An illustration of a TV with a safe zone border on all sides. In width, the top and bottom borders measure 60 points, and the side borders both measure 80 points.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/1be425edd08beb67cba3c1000983581f/visual-design-safe-zone%402x.png)

**Include appropriate padding between focusable elements.** When you use UIKit and the focus APIs, an element gets bigger when it comes into focus. Consider how elements look when they’re focused, and make sure you don’t let them overlap important information. For developer guidance, see [About focus interactions for Apple TV](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/about-focus-interactions-for-apple-tv).

![An illustration that uses vertical shaded rectangles to show padding between focusable items.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/1cfcdddb80150197945945a6884a9ade/visual-design-padding%402x.png)

#### [Grids](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#Grids)

The following grid layouts provide an optimal viewing experience. Be sure to use appropriate spacing between unfocused rows and columns to prevent overlap when an item comes into focus.

If you use the UIKit collection view flow element, the number of columns in a grid is automatically determined based on the width and spacing of your content. For developer guidance, see [`UICollectionViewFlowLayout`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UICollectionViewFlowLayout).

![An illustration of Apple TV, displaying a two-column grid of media items. Additional media items are partially visible on the right side and bottom edge of the screen.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/29cbd7ef913d834c991bd303816e410d/visual-design-grid-2-column%402x.png)

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Unfocused content width | 160 pt |
| Horizontal spacing | 40 pt |
| Minimum vertical spacing | 100 pt |

**Include additional vertical spacing for titled rows.** If a row has a title, provide enough spacing between the bottom of the previous unfocused row and the center of the title to avoid crowding. Also provide spacing between the bottom of the title and the top of the unfocused items in the row.

**Use consistent spacing.** When content isn’t consistently spaced, it no longer looks like a grid and it’s harder for people to scan.

**Make partially hidden content look symmetrical.** To help direct attention to the fully visible content, keep partially hidden offscreen content the same width on each side of the screen.

### [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#visionOS)

The guidance below can help you lay out content within the windows of your visionOS app or game, making it feel familiar and easy to use. For guidance on displaying windows in space and best practices for using depth, scale, and field of view in your visionOS app, see [Spatial layout](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout). To learn more about visionOS window components, see [Windows > visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/windows#visionOS).

**Consider centering the most important content and controls in your app or game.** Often, people can more easily discover and interact with content when it’s near the middle of a window, especially when the window is large.

**Keep a window’s content within its bounds.** In visionOS, the system displays window controls just outside a window’s bounds in the XY plane. For example, the Share menu appears above the window and the controls for resizing, moving, and closing the window appear below it. Letting 2D or 3D content encroach on these areas can make the system-provided controls, especially those below the window, difficult for people to use.

**If you need to display additional controls that don’t belong within a window, use an ornament.** An ornament lets you offer app controls that remain visually associated with a window without interfering with the system-provided controls. For example, a window’s toolbar and tab bar appear as ornaments. For guidance, see [Ornaments](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ornaments).

**Make a window’s interactive components easy for people to look at.** You need to include enough space around an interactive component so that visually identifying it is easy and comfortable, and to prevent the system-provided hover effect from obscuring other content. For example, place buttons so their centers are at least 60 points apart. For guidance, see [Eyes](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/eyes), [Spatial layout](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout), and [Buttons > visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/buttons#visionOS).

### [watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#watchOS)

**Design your content to extend from one edge of the screen to the other.** The Apple Watch bezel provides a natural visual padding around your content. To avoid wasting valuable space, consider minimizing the padding between elements.

![An illustration of the Workout app’s main list of workouts on Apple Watch. A callout indicates that the currently focused workout item spans the full width of the available screen area.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/9b9b27a4e9e752fc4ed6be98f5eb5b0d/layout-full-width%402x.png)

**Avoid placing more than two or three controls side by side in your interface.** As a general rule, display no more than three buttons that contain glyphs — or two buttons that contain text — in a row. Although it’s usually better to let text buttons span the full width of the screen, two side-by-side buttons with short text labels can also work well, as long as the screen doesn’t scroll.

![A diagram of an Apple Watch screen showing two side-by-side buttons beneath three lines of text.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/25c5882538789bded5a9953eb5e2001f/layout-controls%402x.png)

**Support autorotation in views people might want to show others.** When people flip their wrist away, apps typically respond to the motion by sleeping the display, but in some cases it makes sense to autorotate the content. For example, a wearer might want to show an image to a friend or display a QR code to a reader. For developer guidance, see [`isAutorotating`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WatchKit/WKExtension/isAutorotating).

### [iOS, iPadOS device size classes](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout\#iOS-iPadOS-device-size-classes)

A size class is a value that’s either regular or compact, where _regular_ refers to a larger screen or a screen in landscape orientation and _compact_ refers to a smaller screen or a screen in portrait orientation. For developer guidance, see [`UserInterfaceSizeClass`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/UserInterfaceSizeClass).

Different size class combinations apply to the full-screen experience on different devices, based on screen size.

# Materials

A material is a visual effect that creates a sense of depth, layering, and hierarchy between foreground and background elements.

![A sketch of overlapping squares, suggesting the use of transparency to hint at background content. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/7dbd8b65138bed71acdeb36135193681/foundations-materials-intro%402x.png)

Materials help visually separate foreground elements, such as text and controls, from background elements, such as content and solid colors. By allowing color to pass through from background to foreground, a material establishes visual hierarchy to help people more easily retain a sense of place.

Apple platforms feature two types of materials: Liquid Glass, and standard materials. [Liquid Glass](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials#Liquid-Glass) is a dynamic material that unifies the design language across Apple platforms, allowing you to present controls and navigation without obscuring underlying content. In contrast to Liquid Glass, the [standard materials](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials#Standard-materials) help with visual differentiation within the content layer.

## [Liquid Glass](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials\#Liquid-Glass)

Liquid Glass forms a distinct functional layer for controls and navigation elements — like tab bars and sidebars — that floats above the content layer, establishing a clear visual hierarchy between functional elements and content. Liquid Glass allows content to scroll and peek through from beneath these elements to give the interface a sense of dynamism and depth, all while maintaining legibility for controls and navigation.

**Don’t use Liquid Glass in the content layer.** Liquid Glass works best when it provides a clear distinction between interactive elements and content, and including it in the content layer can result in unnecessary complexity and a confusing visual hierarchy. Instead, use [standard materials](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials#Standard-materials) for elements in the content layer, such as app backgrounds. An exception to this is for controls in the content layer with a transient interactive element like [sliders](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sliders) and [toggles](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/toggles); in these cases, the element takes on a Liquid Glass appearance to emphasize its interactivity when a person activates it.

**Use Liquid Glass effects sparingly.** Standard components from system frameworks pick up the appearance and behavior of this material automatically. If you apply Liquid Glass effects to a custom control, do so sparingly. Liquid Glass seeks to bring attention to the underlying content, and overusing this material in multiple custom controls can provide a subpar user experience by distracting from that content. Limit these effects to the most important functional elements in your app. For developer guidance, see [Applying Liquid Glass to custom views](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Applying-Liquid-Glass-to-custom-views).

**Only use clear Liquid Glass for components that appear over visually rich backgrounds.** Liquid Glass provides two variants — [`regular`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Glass/regular) and [`clear`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Glass/clear) — that you can choose when building custom components or styling some system components. The appearance of these variants can differ in response to certain system settings, like if people choose a preferred look for Liquid Glass in their device’s display settings, or turn on accessibility settings that reduce transparency or increase contrast in the interface.

The _regular_ variant blurs and adjusts the luminosity of background content to maintain legibility of text and other foreground elements. Scroll edge effects further enhance legibility by blurring and reducing the opacity of background content. Most system components use this variant. Use the regular variant when background content might create legibility issues, or when components have a significant amount of text, such as alerts, sidebars, or popovers.

![A visual example of the regular variant of Liquid Glass, which appears darker when there is a dark background beneath it.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/91bd48556358ab3deb6720c982aa8503/materials-ios-liquid-glass-regular-on-dark%402x.png)On dark background

![A visual example of the regular variant of Liquid Glass, which appears lighter when there is a light background beneath it.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/07aee30876315c8b2985a59a3ac1df31/materials-ios-liquid-glass-regular-on-light%402x.png)On light background

The _clear_ variant is highly translucent, which is ideal for prioritizing the visibility of the underlying content and ensuring visually rich background elements remain prominent. Use this variant for components that float above media backgrounds — such as photos and videos — to create a more immersive content experience.

![A visual example of the clear variant of Liquid Glass, which allows the visual detail of the background beneath it to show through.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/fe0cd9171626ada19f9ea7343f60a426/materials-ios-liquid-glass-clear%402x.png)

For optimal contrast and legibility, determine whether to add a dimming layer behind components with clear Liquid Glass:

- If the underlying content is bright, consider adding a dark dimming layer of 35% opacity. For developer guidance, see [`clear`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Glass/clear).

- If the underlying content is sufficiently dark, or if you use standard media playback controls from AVKit that provide their own dimming layer, you don’t need to apply a dimming layer.

For guidance about the use of color, see [Liquid Glass color](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color#Liquid-Glass-color).

## [Standard materials](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials\#Standard-materials)

Use standard materials and effects — such as [blur](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIBlurEffect), [vibrancy](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIVibrancyEffect), and [blending modes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSVisualEffectView/BlendingMode-swift.enum) — to convey a sense of structure in the content beneath Liquid Glass.

**Choose materials and effects based on semantic meaning and recommended usage.** Avoid selecting a material or effect based on the apparent color it imparts to your interface, because system settings can change its appearance and behavior. Instead, match the material or vibrancy style to your specific use case.

**Help ensure legibility by using vibrant colors on top of materials.** When you use system-defined vibrant colors, you don’t need to worry about colors seeming too dark, bright, saturated, or low contrast in different contexts. Regardless of the material you choose, use vibrant colors on top of it. For guidance, see [System colors](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color#System-colors).

![An illustration of a Share button with a translucent background material and a symbol. The symbol uses the systemGray3 color and is difficult to see against the background material.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8a395765f911660a5e16b3bdb30ddd2f/materials-legibility-non-vibrant-label%402x.png)Poor contrast between the material and `systemGray3` label

![An X in a circle to indicate incorrect usage](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/209f6f0fc8ad99d9bf59e12d82d06584/crossout%402x.png)

![An illustration of a Share button with a translucent background material and a symbol. The symbol uses vibrant color and is clearly visible against the background material.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/7495cfbce7d79a1f5635ea2a729dfc24/materials-legibility-primary-label%402x.png)Good contrast between the material and vibrant color label

![A checkmark in a circle to indicate correct usage](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/88662da92338267bb64cd2275c84e484/checkmark%402x.png)

**Consider contrast and visual separation when choosing a material to combine with blur and vibrancy effects.** For example, consider that:

- Thicker materials, which are more opaque, can provide better contrast for text and other elements with fine features.

- Thinner materials, which are more translucent, can help people retain their context by providing a visible reminder of the content that’s in the background.

For developer guidance, see [`Material`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Material).

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials\#Platform-considerations)

### [iOS, iPadOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials\#iOS-iPadOS)

In addition to Liquid Glass, iOS and iPadOS continue to provide four standard materials — ultra-thin, thin, regular (default), and thick — which you can use in the content layer to help create visual distinction.

![An illustration of the iOS and iPadOS ultraThin material above a colorful background. Where the material overlaps the background, it provides a diffuse gradient of the background colors.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/2ad0598be0bf67fb23e479f102e16b59/materials-ios-material-background-ultrathin%402x.png)`ultraThin`

![An illustration of the iOS and iPadOS thin material above a colorful background. Where the material overlaps the background, it provides a diffuse and slightly darkened gradient of the background colors.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/d298de701d98a146b1436fdf21d0b7ce/materials-ios-material-background-thin%402x.png)`thin`

![An illustration of the iOS and iPadOS regular material above a colorful background. Where the material overlaps the background, it provides a diffuse and darkened gradient of the background colors.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/93a77ac4cfc0786664563a0691498b05/materials-ios-material-background-regular%402x.png)`regular`

![An illustration of the iOS and iPadOS thick material above a colorful background. Where the material overlaps the background, it provides a dark, muted gradient of the background colors.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/2532ddf965d0effa12f528ac10b5a0b3/materials-ios-material-background-thick%402x.png)`thick`

iOS and iPadOS also define vibrant colors for labels, fills, and separators that are specifically designed to work with each material. Labels and fills both have several levels of vibrancy; separators have one level. The name of a level indicates the relative amount of contrast between an element and the background: The default level has the highest contrast, whereas quaternary (when it exists) has the lowest contrast.

Except for quaternary, you can use the following vibrancy values for labels on any material. In general, avoid using quaternary on top of the [`thin`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Material/thin) and [`ultraThin`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Material/ultraThin) materials, because the contrast is too low.

- [`UIVibrancyEffectStyle.label`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIVibrancyEffectStyle/label) (default)

- [`UIVibrancyEffectStyle.secondaryLabel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIVibrancyEffectStyle/secondaryLabel)

- [`UIVibrancyEffectStyle.tertiaryLabel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIVibrancyEffectStyle/tertiaryLabel)

- [`UIVibrancyEffectStyle.quaternaryLabel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIVibrancyEffectStyle/quaternaryLabel)

You can use the following vibrancy values for fills on all materials.

- [`UIVibrancyEffectStyle.fill`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIVibrancyEffectStyle/fill) (default)

- [`UIVibrancyEffectStyle.secondaryFill`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIVibrancyEffectStyle/secondaryFill)

- [`UIVibrancyEffectStyle.tertiaryFill`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIVibrancyEffectStyle/tertiaryFill)

The system provides a single, default vibrancy value for a [separator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIVibrancyEffectStyle/separator), which works well on all materials.

### [macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials\#macOS)

macOS provides several standard materials with designated purposes, and vibrant versions of all [system colors](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color#Specifications). For developer guidance, see [`NSVisualEffectView.Material`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSVisualEffectView/Material-swift.enum).

**Choose when to allow vibrancy in custom views and controls.** Depending on configuration and system settings, system views and controls use vibrancy to make foreground content stand out against any background. Test your interface in a variety of contexts to discover when vibrancy enhances the appearance and improves communication.

**Choose a background blending mode that complements your interface design.** macOS defines two modes that blend background content: behind window and within window. For developer guidance, see [`NSVisualEffectView.BlendingMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSVisualEffectView/BlendingMode-swift.enum).

### [tvOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials\#tvOS)

In tvOS, Liquid Glass appears throughout navigation elements and system experiences such as Top Shelf and Control Center. Certain interface elements, like image views and buttons, adopt Liquid Glass when they gain focus.

![A screenshot of the Destination Video app running in tvOS. The app shows a screen with details about a video called A BOT-anist Adventure. The background is a colorful image of the main character in a scene from the video. The interface elements floating above the background adopt a Liquid Glass appearance to allow background color to show through and create a more immersive media experience.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/fd83bb7f079cac7b59cb692d8e1c6707/materials-tvos-media-player%402x.png)

In addition to Liquid Glass, tvOS continues to provide standard materials, which you can use to help define structure in the content layer. The thickness of a standard material affects how prominently the underlying content shows through. For example, consider using standard materials in the following ways:

| Material | Recommended for |
| --- | --- |
| [`ultraThin`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Material/ultraThin) | Full-screen views that require a light color scheme |
| [`thin`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Material/thin) | Overlay views that partially obscure onscreen content and require a light color scheme |
| [`regular`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Material/regular) | Overlay views that partially obscure onscreen content |
| [`thick`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Material/thick) | Overlay views that partially obscure onscreen content and require a dark color scheme |

### [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials\#visionOS)

In visionOS, windows generally use an unmodifiable system-defined material called _glass_ that helps people stay grounded by letting light, the current Environment, virtual content, and objects in people’s surroundings show through. Glass is an adaptive material that limits the range of background color information so a window can continue to provide contrast for app content while becoming brighter or darker depending on people’s physical surroundings and other virtual content.

**Prefer translucency to opaque colors in windows.** Areas of opacity can block people’s view, making them feel constricted and reducing their awareness of the virtual and physical objects around them.

![An illustration of a field of view in visionOS with a window in the center. The window has an opaque background that obstructs its surroundings.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/137ceb38a96227aa8a9d2021ee82a8e2/materials-visionos-opaque-window-incorrect%402x.png)

![An X in a circle to indicate incorrect usage](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/209f6f0fc8ad99d9bf59e12d82d06584/crossout%402x.png)

![An illustration of a field of view in visionOS with a window in the center. The window has a translucent material background that allows its surroundings to pass through.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/3f23b3476f6cf8cc77fdcb91a0c15063/materials-visionos-glass-window%402x.png)

![A checkmark in a circle to indicate correct usage](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/88662da92338267bb64cd2275c84e484/checkmark%402x.png)

**If necessary, choose materials that help you create visual separations or indicate interactivity in your app.** If you need to create a custom component, you may need to specify a system material for it. Use the following examples for guidance.

- The [`thin`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Material/thin) material brings attention to interactive elements like buttons and selected items.

- The [`regular`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Material/regular) material can help you visually separate sections of your app, like a sidebar or a grouped table view.

- The [`thick`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Material/thick) material lets you create a dark element that remains visually distinct when it’s on top of an area that uses a `regular` background.

![An illustration of a field of view in visionOS with a window in the center. The window is composed of a sidebar on the left and a content area on the right, with a text field at the top and a button in the lower-right corner. The sidebar uses regular material, while the text field uses thick material and the button uses thin material.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/c3577aa1e00689431e49973173a151f9/visionos-materials-window-example%402x.png)

To ensure foreground content remains legible when it displays on top of a material, visionOS applies vibrancy to text, symbols, and fills. Vibrancy enhances the sense of depth by pulling light and color forward from both virtual and physical surroundings.

visionOS defines three vibrancy values that help you communicate a hierarchy of text, symbols, and fills.

- Use [`UIVibrancyEffectStyle.label`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIVibrancyEffectStyle/label) for standard text.

- Use [`UIVibrancyEffectStyle.secondaryLabel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIVibrancyEffectStyle/secondaryLabel) for descriptive text like footnotes and subtitles.

- Use [`UIVibrancyEffectStyle.tertiaryLabel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIVibrancyEffectStyle/tertiaryLabel) for inactive elements, and only when text doesn’t need high legibility.

![An illustration of a Share button with a translucent background material and a symbol. The symbol uses the default vibrant label color and has very high contrast against the background material.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8f850521ecc2e3953e8e693fe7b4887b/materials-visionos-label-vibrant-primary%402x.png)`label`

![An illustration of a Share button with a translucent background material and a symbol. The symbol uses the secondary vibrant label color and has high contrast against the background material.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/876503f2b2b5fd1783e359128ffd2482/materials-visionos-label-vibrant-secondary%402x.png)`secondaryLabel`

![An illustration of a Share button with a translucent background material and a symbol. The symbol uses the tertiary vibrant label color and has muted contrast against the background material.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/b3b80e5f23b286f6c7897780676e6dfe/materials-visionos-label-vibrant-tertiary%402x.png)`tertiaryLabel`

### [watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials\#watchOS)

**Use materials to provide context in a full-screen modal view.** Because full-screen modal views are common in watchOS, the contrast provided by material layers can help orient people in your app and distinguish controls and system elements from other content. Avoid removing or replacing material backgrounds for modal sheets when they’re provided by default.

![An illustration of a modal view in watchOS with an example title, descriptive text, and a single action button. The modal completely covers the screen with a transparent material, and uses a thinner material for the button along with vibrant label text.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/b9bdbaa947d461e98681c9fbb87a7052/watchos-modal-view-material-background%402x.png)

# Branding

Apps and games express their unique brand identity in ways that make them instantly recognizable while feeling at home on the platform and giving people a consistent experience.

![A sketch of a megaphone, suggesting communication. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8ea20e1bc15bc51d9242f39c27cbb0c6/foundations-branding-intro%402x.png)

In addition to expressing your brand in your [app icon](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons) and throughout your experience, you have several opportunities to highlight it within the App Store. For guidance, see [App Store Marketing Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/).

## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/branding\#Best-practices)

**Use your brand’s unique voice and tone in all the written communication you display.** For example, your brand might convey feelings of encouragement and optimism by using plain words, occasional exclamation marks and emoji, and simple sentence structures.

**Consider choosing an accent color.** On most platforms, you can specify a color that the system applies to app elements like interface icons, buttons, and text. In macOS, people can also choose their own accent color that the system can use in place of the color an app specifies. For guidance, see [Color](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color).

**Consider using a custom font.** If your brand is strongly associated with a specific font, be sure that it’s legible at all sizes and supports accessibility features like bold text and larger type. It can work well to use a custom font for headlines and subheadings while using a system font for body copy and captions, because the system fonts are designed for optimal legibility at small sizes. For guidance, see [Typography](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography).

**Ensure branding always defers to content.** Using screen space for an element that does nothing but display a brand asset can mean there’s less room for the content people care about. Aim to incorporate branding in refined, unobtrusive ways that don’t distract people from your experience.

**Help people feel comfortable by using standard patterns consistently.** Even a highly stylized interface can be approachable if it maintains familiar behaviors. For example, place UI components in expected locations and use standard symbols to represent common actions.

**Resist the temptation to display your logo throughout your app or game unless it’s essential for providing context.** People seldom need to be reminded which app they’re using, and it’s usually better to use the space to give people valuable information and controls.

**Avoid using a launch screen as a branding opportunity.** Some platforms use a launch screen to minimize the startup experience, while simultaneously giving the app or game a little time to load resources (for guidance, see [Launch screens](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/launching#Launch-screens)). A launch screen disappears too quickly to convey any information, but you might consider displaying a welcome or onboarding screen that incorporates your branding content at the beginning of your experience. For guidance, see [Onboarding](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/onboarding).

**Follow Apple’s trademark guidelines.** Apple trademarks must not appear in your app name or images. See [Apple Trademark List](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html) and [Guidelines for Using Apple Trademarks](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html).

# Motion

Beautiful, fluid motions bring the interface to life, conveying status, providing feedback and instruction, and enriching the visual experience of your app or game.

![A sketch of three overlapping diamonds, suggesting the movement of an element from left to right. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/1a0efd7807cfcba7a5821be86b20bafc/foundations-motion-intro%402x.png)

Many system components automatically include motion, letting you offer familiar and consistent experiences throughout your app or game. System components might also adjust their motion in response to factors like accessibility settings or different input methods. For example, the movement of [Liquid Glass](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials#Liquid-Glass) responds to direct touch interaction with greater emphasis to reinforce the feeling of a tactile experience, but produces a more subdued effect when a person interacts using a trackpad.

If you design custom motion, follow the guidelines below.

## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/motion\#Best-practices)

**Add motion purposefully, supporting the experience without overshadowing it.** Don’t add motion for the sake of adding motion. Gratuitous or excessive animation can distract people and may make them feel disconnected or physically uncomfortable.

**Make motion optional.** Not everyone can or wants to experience the motion in your app or game, so it’s essential to avoid using it as the only way to communicate important information. To help everyone enjoy your app or game, supplement visual feedback by also using alternatives like [haptics](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics) and [audio](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-audio) to communicate.

## [Providing feedback](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/motion\#Providing-feedback)

**Strive for realistic feedback motion that follows people’s gestures and expectations.** In nongame apps, accurate, realistic motion can help people understand how something works, but feedback motion that doesn’t make sense can make them feel disoriented. For example, if someone reveals a view by sliding it down from the top, they don’t expect to dismiss the view by sliding it to the side.

**Aim for brevity and precision in feedback animations.** When animated feedback is brief and precise, it tends to feel lightweight and unobtrusive, and it can often convey information more effectively than prominent animation. For example, when a game displays a succinct animation that’s precisely tied to a successful action, players can instantly get the message without being distracted from their gameplay. Another example is in visionOS: When people tap a panorama in Photos, it quickly and smoothly expands to fill the space in front of them, helping them track the transition without making them wait to enjoy the content.

**In apps, generally avoid adding motion to UI interactions that occur frequently.** The system already provides subtle animations for interactions with standard interface elements. For a custom element, you generally want to avoid making people spend extra time paying attention to unnecessary motion every time they interact with it.

**Let people cancel motion.** As much as possible, don’t make people wait for an animation to complete before they can do anything, especially if they have to experience the animation more than once.

**Consider using animated symbols where it makes sense.** When you use SF Symbols 5 or later, you can apply animations to SF Symbols or custom symbols. For guidance, see [Animations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols#Animations).

## [Leveraging platform capabilities](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/motion\#Leveraging-platform-capabilities)

**Make sure your game’s motion looks great by default on each platform you support.** In most games, maintaining a consistent frame rate of 30 to 60 fps typically results in a smooth, visually appealing experience. For each platform you support, use the device’s graphics capabilities to enable default settings that let people enjoy your game without first having to change those settings.

**Let people customize the visual experience of your game to optimize performance or battery life.** For example, consider letting people switch between power modes when the system detects the presence of an external power source.

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/motion\#Platform-considerations)

_No additional considerations for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, or tvOS._

### [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/motion\#visionOS)

In addition to subtly communicating context, drawing attention to information, and enriching immersive experiences, motion in visionOS can combine with [depth](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout#Depth) to provide essential feedback when people look at interactive elements. Because motion is likely to be a large part of your visionOS experience, it’s crucial to avoid causing distraction, confusion, or discomfort.

**As much as possible, avoid displaying motion at the edges of a person’s field of view.** People can be particularly sensitive to motion that occurs in their peripheral vision: in addition to being distracting, such motion can even cause discomfort because it can make people feel like they or their surroundings are moving. If you need to show an object moving in the periphery during an immersive experience, make sure the object’s brightness level is similar to the rest of the visible content.

**Help people remain comfortable when showing the movement of large virtual objects.** If an object is large enough to fill a lot of the [field of view](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout#Field-of-view), occluding most or all of [passthrough](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/immersive-experiences#Immersion-and-passthrough), people can naturally perceive it as being part of their surroundings. To help people perceive the object’s movement without making them think that they or their surroundings are moving, you can increase the object’s translucency, helping people see through it, or lower its contrast to make its motion less noticeable.

**Consider using fades when you need to relocate an object.** When an object moves from one location to another, people naturally watch the movement. If such movement doesn’t communicate anything useful to people, you can fade the object out before moving it and fade it back in after it’s in the new location.

**In general, avoid letting people rotate a virtual world.** When a virtual world rotates, the experience typically upsets people’s sense of stability, even when they control the rotation and the movement is subtle. Instead, consider using instantaneous directional changes during a quick fade-out.

**Consider giving people a stationary frame of reference.** It can be easier for people to handle visual movement when it’s contained within an area that doesn’t move. In contrast, if the entire surrounding area appears to move — for example, in a game that automatically moves a player through space — people can feel unwell.

**Avoid showing objects that oscillate in a sustained way.** In particular, you want to avoid showing an oscillation that has a frequency of around 0.2 Hz because people can be very sensitive to this frequency. If you need to show objects oscillating, aim to keep the amplitude low and consider making the content translucent.

### [watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/motion\#watchOS)

SwiftUI provides a powerful and streamlined way to add motion to your app. If you need to use WatchKit to animate layout and appearance changes — or create animated image sequences — see [`WKInterfaceImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WatchKit/WKInterfaceImage#1652345).

# Privacy

Privacy is paramount: it’s critical to be transparent about the privacy-related data and resources you require and essential to protect the data people allow you to access.

![A sketch of an upright hand, suggesting protection. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/161fec1d77c705ccf076fb4c67d32f5c/foundations-privacy-intro%402x.png)

People use their devices in very personal ways and they expect apps to help them preserve their privacy.

When you submit a new or updated app, you must provide details about your privacy practices and the privacy-relevant data you collect so the App Store can display the information on your product page. (You can manage this information at any time in [App Store Connect](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev1b4647c5b).) People use the privacy details on your product page to make an informed decision before they download your app. To learn more, see [App privacy details on the App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/).

![A screenshot of the App Privacy screen in an app’s App Store product page. The top card in the screen is titled Data Used to Track You and lists contact info, other data, and identifiers. The bottom card is titled Data Linked to You and lists health and fitness, financial info, contact info, purchases, location, and contacts.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/50727e3a2229fda1e6fa93ca9677cc7f/privacy-social-media-app-store-nutrition-labels%402x.png)

An app’s App Store product page helps people understand the app’s privacy practices before they download it.

## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy\#Best-practices)

**Request access only to data that you actually need.** Asking for more data than a feature needs — or asking for data before a person shows interest in the feature — can make it hard for people to trust your app. Give people precise control over their data by making your permission requests as specific as possible.

**Be transparent about how your app collects and uses people’s data.** People are less likely to be comfortable sharing data with your app if they don’t understand exactly how you plan to use it. Always respect people’s choices to use system features like Hide My Email and Mail Privacy Protection, and be sure you understand your obligations with regard to app tracking. To learn more about Apple privacy features, see [Privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/); for developer guidance, see [User privacy and data use](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/).

**Process data on the device where possible.** In iOS, for example, you can take advantage of the Apple Neural Engine and custom CreateML models to process the data right on the device, helping you avoid lengthy and potentially risky round trips to a remote server.

**Adopt system-defined privacy protections and follow security best practices.** For example, in iOS 15 and later, you can rely on CloudKit to provide encryption and key management for additional data types, like strings, numbers, and dates.

## [Requesting permission](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy\#Requesting-permission)

Here are several examples of the things you must request permission to access:

- Personal data, including location, health, financial, contact, and other personally identifying information

- User-generated content like emails, messages, calendar data, contacts, gameplay information, Apple Music activity, HomeKit data, and audio, video, and photo content

- Protected resources like Bluetooth peripherals, home automation features, Wi-Fi connections, and local networks

- Device capabilities like camera and microphone

- In a visionOS app running in a Full Space, ARKit data, such as hand tracking, plane estimation, image anchoring, and world tracking

- The device’s advertising identifier, which supports app tracking

The system provides a standard alert that lets people view each request you make. You supply copy that describes why your app needs access, and the system displays your description in the alert. People can also view the description — and update their choice — in Settings > Privacy.

**Request permission only when your app clearly needs access to the data or resource.** It’s natural for people to be suspicious of a request for personal information or access to a device capability, especially if there’s no obvious need for it. Ideally, wait to request permission until people actually use an app feature that requires access. For example, you can use the [location button](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy#Location-button) to give people a way to share their location after they indicate interest in a feature that needs that information.

**Avoid requesting permission at launch unless the data or resource is required for your app to function.** People are less likely to be bothered by a launch-time request when it’s obvious why you’re making it. For example, people understand that a navigation app needs access to their location before they can benefit from it. Similarly, before people can play a visionOS game that lets them bounce virtual objects off walls in their surroundings, they need to permit the game to access information about their surroundings.

**Write copy that clearly describes how your app uses the ability, data, or resource you’re requesting.** The standard alert displays your copy (called a _purpose string_ or _usage description string_) after your app name and before the buttons people use to grant or deny their permission. Aim for a brief, complete sentence that’s straightforward, specific, and easy to understand. Use sentence case, avoid passive voice, and include a period at the end. For developer guidance, see [Requesting access to protected resources](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/requesting-access-to-protected-resources) and [App Tracking Transparency](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppTrackingTransparency).

Here are several examples of the standard system alert:

### [Pre-alert screens, windows, or views](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy\#Pre-alert-screens-windows-or-views)

Ideally, the current context helps people understand why you’re requesting their permission. If it’s essential to provide additional details, you can display a custom screen or window before the system alert appears. The following guidelines apply to custom views that display before system alerts that request permission to access protected data and resources, including camera, microphone, location, contact, calendar, and tracking.

**Include only one button and make it clear that it opens the system alert.** People can feel manipulated when a custom screen or window also includes a button that doesn’t open the alert because the experience diverts them from making their choice. Another type of manipulation is using a term like “Allow” to title the custom screen’s button. If the custom button seems similar in meaning and visual weight to the allow button in the alert, people can be more likely to choose the alert’s allow button without meaning to. Use a term like “Continue” or “Next” to title the single button in your custom screen or window, clarifying that its action is to open the system alert.

![A screenshot of an app's pre-alert screen that reads Turning on location services allows us to provide features like: alerts when your friends are nearby, news of events happening near you, tagging and sharing your location. You can change this later in the Settings app. Below the text is a button titled Next.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/bda87e1bb5098ab79fee0d0a3be3a10b/privacy-custom-messaging-correct%402x.png)

**Don’t include additional actions in your custom screen or window.** For example, don’t provide a way for people to leave the screen or window without viewing the system alert — like offering an option to close or cancel.

### [Tracking requests](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy\#Tracking-requests)

App tracking is a sensitive issue. In some cases, it might make sense to display a custom screen or window that describes the benefits of tracking. If you want to perform app tracking as soon as people launch your app, you must display the system-provided alert before you collect any tracking data.

**Never precede the system-provided alert with a custom screen or window that could confuse or mislead people.** People sometimes tap quickly to dismiss alerts without reading them. A custom messaging screen, window, or view that takes advantage of such behaviors to influence choices will lead to rejection by App Store review.

There are several prohibited custom-screen designs that will cause rejection. Some examples are offering incentives, displaying a screen or window that looks like a request, displaying an image of the alert, and annotating the screen behind the alert (as shown below). To learn more, see [App Review Guidelines: 5.1.1 (iv)](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#data-collection-and-storage).

![A screenshot of an app’s pre-tracking message that reads Allow tracking and get a $100 credit toward your next purchase. Below the text is an image of a dollar sign inside a circle. Below the image is a button titled Get $100 credit.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/6000f4e89c244b12c8438aec034f7d1b/privacy-custom-messaging-prohibited-incentive%402x.png)

![An X in a circle to indicate an incorrect example.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/209f6f0fc8ad99d9bf59e12d82d06584/crossout%402x.png)Don’t offer incentives for granting the request. You can’t offer people compensation for granting their permission, and you can’t withhold functionality or content or make your app unusable until people allow you to track them.

![A screenshot of an app’s pre-tracking message that reads Allow tracking for a better experience. Below the text is a bar graph image that shows four bars increasing in height from left to right. Below the graph is a button titled Allow Tracking.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/f1d292d13b6548e9eb72397e0d3ad760/privacy-custom-messaging-prohibited-imitation%402x.png)

![An X in a circle to indicate an incorrect example.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/209f6f0fc8ad99d9bf59e12d82d06584/crossout%402x.png)Don’t display a custom screen that mirrors the functionality of the system alert. In particular, don’t create a button title that uses “Allow” or similar terms, because people don’t allow anything in a pre-alert screen.

![A screenshot of an app’s pre-tracking message that reads Choose Allow when prompted. Below the text is an image of the system-provided alert. Below the image is a button titled Continue. The Allow While Using the App button in the system-provided alert image is circled.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5ae208fd0806ac0d7e89f9939a93c6e5/privacy-custom-messaging-prohibited-alert%402x.png)

![An X in a circle to indicate an incorrect example.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/209f6f0fc8ad99d9bf59e12d82d06584/crossout%402x.png)Don’t show an image of the standard alert and modify it in any way.

![A screenshot of an app’s pre-tracking message that reads Allow tracking for a better experience. The app’s custom screen also includes an upward-pointing arrow and the words Choose Allow in the lower third of the screen.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/780cf726198155101ee7cff6d786669f/privacy-custom-messaging-prohibited-alert-annotation%402x.png)

![An X in a circle to indicate an incorrect example.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/209f6f0fc8ad99d9bf59e12d82d06584/crossout%402x.png)Don’t add a visual cue that draws people’s attention to the system alert’s Allow buttons.

## [Location button](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy\#Location-button)

In iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS, Core Location provides a button so people can grant your app temporary authorization to access their location at the moment a task needs it. A location button’s appearance can vary to match your app’s UI and it always communicates the action of location sharing in a way that’s instantly recognizable.

![An image of a lozenge-shaped blue button that displays a white location indicator — that is, a narrow arrow head shape that points to the top right — followed by the text Current Location.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/2d4e44adec80170cec96d3446617e700/location-button%402x.png)

The first time people open your app and tap a location button, the system displays a standard alert. The alert helps people understand how using the button limits your app’s access to their location, and reminds them of the location indicator that appears when sharing starts.

![A screenshot of the alert displayed by the location button that appears on top of a background image showing a partial map. The alert reads Allow Social Media to access your location? Turning on location  will allow us to show you nearby post locations. Below this text the alert displays a small image of the map, zoomed in to show part of Cupertino. Below the map are three buttons; from the top the titles are Allow Once, Allow While Using App, and Don't Allow.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5cff6abb7fc42b749c616ab763a09968/privacy-social-media-map-location-alert%402x.png)

After people confirm their understanding of the button’s action, simply tapping the location button gives your app one-time permission to access their location. Although each one-time authorization expires when people stop using your app, they don’t need to reconfirm their understanding of the button’s behavior.

**Consider using the location button to give people a lightweight way to share their location for specific app features.** For example, your app might help people attach their location to a message or post, find a store, or identify a building, plant, or animal they’ve encountered in their location. If you know that people often grant your app _Allow Once_ permission, consider using the location button to help them benefit from sharing their location without having to repeatedly interact with the alert.

**Consider customizing the location button to harmonize with your UI.** Specifically, you can:

- Choose the system-provided title that works best with your feature, such as “Current Location” or “Share My Current Location.”

- Choose the filled or outlined location glyph.

- Select a background color and a color for the title and glyph.

- Adjust the button’s corner radius.

To help people recognize and trust location buttons, you can’t customize the button’s other visual attributes. The system also ensures a location button remains legible by warning you about problems like low-contrast color combinations or too much translucency. In addition to fixing such problems, you’re responsible for making sure the text fits in the button — for example, button text needs to fit without truncation at all accessibility text sizes and when translated into other languages.

## [Protecting data](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy\#Protecting-data)

Protecting people’s information is paramount. Give people confidence in your app’s security and help preserve their privacy by taking advantage of system-provided security technologies when you need to store information locally, authorize people for specific operations, and transport information across a network.

Here are some high-level guidelines.

**Avoid relying solely on passwords for authentication.** Where possible, use [passkeys](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/public-private_key_authentication/supporting_passkeys/) to replace passwords. If you need to continue using passwords for authentication, augment security by requiring two-factor authentication (for developer guidance, see [Securing Logins with iCloud Keychain Verification Codes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AuthenticationServices/securing-logins-with-icloud-keychain-verification-codes)). To further protect access to apps that people keep logged in on their device, use biometric identification like Face ID, Optic ID, or Touch ID. For developer guidance, see [Local Authentication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/LocalAuthentication).

**Store sensitive information in a keychain.** A keychain provides a secure, predictable user experience when handling someone’s private information. For developer guidance, see [Keychain services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/keychain-services).

**Never store passwords or other secure content in plain-text files.** Even if you restrict access using file permissions, sensitive information is much safer in an encrypted keychain.

**Avoid inventing custom authentication schemes.** If your app requires authentication, prefer system-provided features like [passkeys](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/public-private_key_authentication/supporting_passkeys/), [Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sign-in-with-apple) or [Password AutoFill](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/password-autofill). For related guidance, see [Managing accounts](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/managing-accounts).

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy\#Platform-considerations)

_No additional considerations for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, or watchOS._

### [macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy\#macOS)

**Sign your app with a valid Developer ID.** If you choose to distribute your app outside the store, signing your app with Developer ID identifies you as an Apple developer and confirms that your app is safe to use. For developer guidance, see [Xcode Help](https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=ios-app-distribution-guide).

**Protect people’s data with app sandboxing.** Sandboxing provides your app with access to system resources and user data while protecting it from malware. All apps submitted to the Mac App Store require sandboxing. For developer guidance, see [Configuring the macOS App Sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/configuring-the-macos-app-sandbox).

**Avoid making assumptions about who is signed in.** Because of fast user switching, multiple people may be active on the same system.

### [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy\#visionOS)

By default, visionOS uses ARKit algorithms to handle features like persistence, world mapping, segmentation, matting, and environment lighting. These algorithms are always running, allowing apps and games to automatically benefit from ARKit while in the Shared Space.

ARKit doesn’t send data to apps in the Shared Space; to access ARKit APIs, your app must open a Full Space. Additionally, features like Plane Estimation, Scene Reconstruction, Image Anchoring, and Hand Tracking require people’s permission to access any information. For developer guidance, see [Setting up access to ARKit data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/setting-up-access-to-arkit-data).

In visionOS, user input is private by design. The system automatically displays hover effects when people look at interactive components you create using SwiftUI or RealityKit, giving people the visual feedback they need without exposing where they’re looking before they tap. For guidance, see [Eyes](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/eyes) and [Gestures > visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/gestures#visionOS).

Developer access to device cameras works differently in visionOS than it does in other platforms. Specifically, the back camera provides blank input and is only available as a compatibility convenience; the front camera provides input for [spatial Personas](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/shareplay#visionOS), but only after people grant their permission. If the iOS or iPadOS app you’re bringing to visionOS includes a feature that needs camera access, remove it or replace it with an option for people to import content instead. For developer guidance, see [Making your existing app compatible with visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/making-your-app-compatible-with-visionos).

# Right to left

Support right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew by reversing your interface as needed to match the reading direction of the related scripts.

![A sketch of a right-aligned bulleted list within a window, suggesting an interface displayed in a right-to-left language. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5d683460f2af897b631f4dad86fd3473/foundations-rtl-intro%402x.png)

When people choose a language for their device — or just your app or game — they expect the interface to adapt in various ways (to learn more, see [Localization](https://developer.apple.com/localization/)).

System-provided UI frameworks support right-to-left (RTL) by default, allowing system-provided UI components to flip automatically in the RTL context. If you use system-provided elements and standard layouts, you might not need to make any changes to your app’s automatically reversed interface.

If you want to fine-tune your layout or enhance specific localizations to adapt to different currencies, numerals, or mathematical symbols that can occur in various locales in countries that use RTL languages, follow these guidelines.

## [Text alignment](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left\#Text-alignment)

**Adjust text alignment to match the interface direction, if the system doesn’t do so automatically.** For example, if you left-align text with content in the left-to-right (LTR) context, right-align the text to match the content’s mirrored position in the RTL context.

![An illustration showing a layout of text and images in an interface. Three bars that represent text are left-aligned above a rounded rectangle area. A placeholder image is centered in the area, above another bar at the bottom edge. The bar inside the area is left-aligned.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/7bdc0741a96d6e2aa88b79c64e151c8a/text-alignment-ltr-screen%402x.png)Left-aligned text in the LTR context

![An illustration showing a layout of text and images in an interface. Three bars that represent text are right-aligned above a rounded rectangle area.

The placeholder image isn't flipped.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/10386033d677b3fd65ec33ac16d67e56/text-alignment-rtl-screen%402x.png)Right-aligned content in the RTL context

**Align a paragraph based on its language, not on the current context.** When the alignment of a paragraph — defined as three or more lines of text — doesn’t match its language, it can be difficult to read. For example, right-aligning a paragraph that consists of LTR text can make the beginning of each line difficult to see. To improve readability, continue aligning one- and two-line text blocks to match the reading direction of the current context, but align a paragraph to match its language.

![An image showing two paragraphs of placeholder copy. The first paragraph is in Arabic and is right-aligned. The second paragraph is in English and is left-aligned.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/b32ae443b1d7daa1bb661b56b42b8a34/paragraph-alignment-correct%402x.png)A left-aligned paragraph in the RTL context

![An image showing two paragraphs of placeholder copy. The first paragraph is in Arabic and the second paragraph is in English.

**Use a consistent alignment for all text items in a list.** To ensure a comfortable reading and scanning experience, reverse the alignment of all items in a list, including items that are displayed in a different script.

![An illustration of a right-aligned list of gray bars that represent right-to-left text.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8e497bdc80a98b7896b492d2e5bfb57b/mixed-script-list-alignment-correct%402x.png)Right-aligned content in the RTL context

## [Numbers and characters](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left\#Numbers-and-characters)

Different RTL languages can use different number systems. For example, Hebrew text uses Western Arabic numerals, whereas Arabic text might use either Western or Eastern Arabic numerals. The use of Western and Eastern Arabic numerals varies among countries and regions and even among areas within the same country or region.

If your app covers mathematical concepts or other number-centric topics, it’s a good idea to identify the appropriate way to display such information in each locale you support. In contrast, apps that don’t address number-related topics can generally rely on system-provided number representations.

![From the left, the numerals one, two, and three in Western Arabic numerals.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/c40d3d208a9aee56d680d6915fb44fff/textformat-123-ltr%402x.png)Western Arabic numerals

![From the right, the numerals one, two, and three in Eastern Arabic numerals.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8a9f9c2f6fb291304a5d93e27be0bead/textformat-123-ar%402x.png)Eastern Arabic numerals

**Don’t reverse the order of numerals in a specific number.** Regardless of the current language or the surrounding content, the digits in a specific number — such as “541,” a phone number, or a credit card number — always appear in the same order.

![From the left, the two words order and number followed by the number 123456 in Latin script.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/e6ae8d9dab2a6da825829cf88bfb6adb/latin-numerals%402x.png)Latin

![From the right, the two words order and number in Arabic script, followed by the number 12345 in Western Arabic numerals.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/427e50992b8e4900fa7f64c73ad8c0b1/western-arabic-numerals%402x.png)Arabic (Western Arabic numerals)

![From the right, the two words order and number in Arabic script, followed by the number 12345 in Eastern Arabic numerals.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/6edfa8597370c06b66cdbbaae728f97b/eastern-arabic-numerals%402x.png)Arabic (Eastern Arabic numerals)

**Reverse the order of numerals that show progress or a counting direction; never flip the numerals themselves.** Controls like progress bars, sliders, and rating controls often include numerals to clarify their meaning. If you use numerals in this way, be sure to reverse the order of the numerals to match the direction of the flipped control. Also reverse a sequence of numerals if you use the sequence to communicate a specific order.

## [Controls](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left\#Controls)

**Flip controls that show progress from one value to another.** Because people tend to view forward progress as moving in the same direction as the language they read, it makes sense to flip controls like sliders and progress indicators in the RTL context. When you do this, also be sure to reverse the positions of the accompanying glyphs or images that depict the beginning and ending values of the control.

![An illustration of a volume control slider. The left side has a right-facing speaker glyph with no sound emerging, and the right side has a right-facing speaker glyph with sound waves projecting from it, showing that moving the thumb from left to right makes the volume louder.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/7ef757b48788617e37c2a275b6b47f6d/flipped-directional-control-ltr%402x.png)A directional control in the LTR context

**Flip controls that help people navigate or access items in a fixed order.** For example, in the RTL context, a back button must point to the right so the flow of screens matches the reading order of the RTL language. Similarly, next or previous buttons that let people access items in an ordered list need to flip in the RTL context to match the reading order.

**Preserve the direction of a control that refers to an actual direction or points to an onscreen area.** For example, if you provide a control that means “to the right,” it must always point right, regardless of the current context.

**Visually balance adjacent Latin and RTL scripts when necessary.** In buttons, labels, and titles, Arabic or Hebrew text can appear too small when next to uppercased Latin text, because Arabic and Hebrew don’t include uppercase letters. To visually balance Arabic or Hebrew text with Latin text that uses all capitals, it often works well to increase the RTL font size by about 2 points.

![A horizontal row of three blue oval buttons. Each button is labeled with the word download. From the left, the labels are in Latin, Arabic, and Hebrew scripts, with the English label using all capital letters. Two horizontal red lines run across all three buttons, the top line is the ascender line and the bottom line is the baseline. Every letter in the English label touches both lines. Only the last two letters in the Arabic label touch or extend below the baseline; only the last letter touches the ascender line. No letters in the Hebrew label touch either line. In comparison with the Latin label, both the Arabic and Hebrew labels look small.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/190b48a71d8d934047905be986732fb4/download-uneven-vertical-height%402x.png)Arabic and Hebrew text can look too small next to uppercased Latin text of the same font size.

The last two letters in the Arabic label touch or extend below the baseline, and the first and last letters extend above the ascender line. All letters in the Hebrew label touch the base line and the ascender line.

## [Images](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left\#Images)

**Avoid flipping images like photographs, illustrations, and general artwork.** Flipping an image often changes the image’s meaning; flipping a copyrighted image could be a violation. If an image’s content is strongly connected to reading direction, consider creating a new version of the image instead of flipping the original.

**Reverse the positions of images when their order is meaningful.** For example, if you display multiple images in a specific order like chronological, alphabetical, or favorite, reverse their positions to preserve the order’s meaning in the RTL context.

## [Interface icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left\#Interface-icons)

When you use [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols) to supply interface icons for your app, you get variants for the RTL context and localized symbols for Arabic and Hebrew, among other languages. If you create custom symbols, you can specify their directionality. For developer guidance, see [Creating custom symbol images for your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/creating-custom-symbol-images-for-your-app).

**Flip interface icons that represent text or reading direction.** For example, if an interface icon uses left-aligned bars to represent text in the LTR context, right-align the bars in the RTL context.

![A rounded rectangle that contains three horizontal left-aligned lines.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/298befd594e841846cd466f60d2bea6a/doc-plaintext-ltr%402x.png)LTR variant of a symbol that represents text

**Consider creating a localized version of an interface icon that displays text.** Some interface icons include letters or words to help communicate a script-related concept, like font-size choice or a signature. If you have a custom interface icon that needs to display actual text, consider creating a localized version. For example, SF Symbols offers different versions of the signature, rich-text, and I-beam pointer symbols for use with Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic text, among others.

![A small X left-aligned above a horizontal line. A stylized signature begins at the X and finishes at the right end of the line.

If you have a custom interface icon that uses letters or words to communicate a concept unrelated to reading or writing, consider designing an alternative image that doesn’t use text.

**Flip an interface icon that shows forward or backward motion.** When something moves in the same direction that people read, they typically interpret that direction as forward; when something moves in the opposite direction, people tend to interpret the direction as backward. An interface icon that depicts an object moving forward or backward needs to flip in the RTL context to preserve the meaning of the motion. For example, an icon that represents a speaker typically shows sound waves emanating forward from the speaker. In the LTR context, the sound waves come from the left, so in the RTL context, the icon needs to flip to show the waves coming from the right.

![The outline of a speaker with three concentric curved lines emanating to the right.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/d43d629eea61239a9268d6616551b48c/speaker-wave-3-ltr%402x.png)LTR variant of a symbol that depicts forward motion

**Don’t flip logos or universal signs and marks.** Displaying a flipped logo confuses people and can have legal repercussions. Always display a logo in its original form, even if it includes text. People expect universal symbols and marks like the checkmark to have a consistent appearance, so avoid flipping them.

![A rounded square that contains the black Apple TV logo, which consists of a solid black apple to the left of the lowercase letters T and V.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/7c7eb6d19b63d77412c7754893c0f65c/appletv-ltr%402x.png)A logo

**In general, avoid flipping interface icons that depict real-world objects.** Unless you use the object to indicate directionality, it’s best to avoid flipping an icon that represents a familiar item. For example, clocks work the same everywhere, so a traditional clock interface icon needs to look the same regardless of language direction. Some interface icons might seem to reference language or reading direction because they represent items that are slanted for right-handed use. However, most people are right-handed, so flipping an icon that shows a right-handed tool isn’t necessary and might be confusing.

![A black disk with two white lines in the nine o'clock position.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/2d167db99027c9f44270a86a273f225f/clock-fill-ltr%402x.png)

![A pencil with an eraser, slanted at about forty-five degrees with the point in the bottom-left.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/6597719e77e19638bb265cd6c58f9a8a/pencil-ltr%402x.png)

![The silhouette of a game controller with a white plus sign on the left and two white buttons on the right.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/c3f51c228de248bf096aae7164836eab/gamecontroller-fill-ltr%402x.png)

**Before merely flipping a complex custom interface icon, consider its individual components and the overall visual balance.** In some cases, a component — like a badge, slash, or magnifying glass — needs to adhere to a visual design language regardless of localization. For example, SF Symbols maintains visual consistency by using the same backslash to represent the prohibition or negation of a symbol’s meaning in both LTR and RTL versions.

![A silhouette of a speaker pointing right with a backslash on top of it.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/0557fd6fd8fc1b2c347cd869baa6ae0e/speaker-slash-fill-ltr%402x.png)LTR variant of a symbol that includes a backslash

In other cases, you might need to flip a component (or its position) to ensure the localized version of the icon still makes sense. For example, if a badge represents the actual UI that people see in your app, it needs to flip if your UI flips. Alternatively, if a badge modifies the meaning of an interface icon, consider whether flipping the badge preserves both the modified meaning and the overall visual balance of the icon. In the images shown below, the badge doesn’t depict an object in the UI, but keeping it in the top-right corner visually unbalances the cart.

If your custom interface icon includes a component that can imply handedness, like a tool, consider preserving the orientation of the tool while flipping the base image if necessary.

# Inclusion

Inclusive apps and games put people first by prioritizing respectful communication and presenting content and functionality in ways that everyone can access and understand.

![A sketch of two people, suggesting inclusion. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/498c87708887321ec79abcf0c45abc66/foundations-inclusion-intro%402x.png)

To help you design an inclusive app or game, consider the following goals as you review the words and images you use and the experiences you offer.

As with all design, designing an inclusive app is an iterative process that takes time to get right. Throughout the process, be prepared to examine your assumptions about how other people think and feel and be open to evolving knowledge and understanding.

## [Inclusive by design](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion\#Inclusive-by-design)

Simple, intuitive experiences are at the core of well-designed apps and games. To design an intuitive experience, you start by investigating people’s goals and perspectives so you can present content that resonates with them.

Empathy is an important tool in this investigation because it helps you understand how people with different perspectives might respond to the content and experiences you create. For example, you might discover that from some perspectives a word or image is incomprehensible or has a meaning you don’t intend.

Although each person’s perspective comprises a unique intersection of human qualities that’s both distinct and dynamic, all perspectives arise from human characteristics and experiences that everyone shares, including:

- Age

- Gender and gender identity

- Race and ethnicity

- Sexuality

- Physical attributes

- Cognitive attributes

- Permanent, temporary, and situational disabilities

- Language and culture

- Religion

- Education

- Political or philosophical opinions

- Social and economic context

As you examine your app or game through different perspectives, avoid framing the work as merely a search for content that might give offense. Although no design should contain offensive material or experiences, an inoffensive app or game isn’t necessarily an inclusive one. Focusing on inclusion can help you avoid potentially offensive content while also helping you create a welcoming experience that everyone can enjoy.

## [Welcoming language](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion\#Welcoming-language)

Using plain, inclusive language welcomes everyone and helps them understand your app or game. Carefully review the writing in your experience to make sure that your tone and words don’t exclude people. Here are a few tips for writing text — also known as _copy_ — that’s direct, easy to understand, and inclusive.

**Consider the tone of your copy from different perspectives.** The style of your writing communicates almost as much as the words you use. Although different apps use different communication styles, make sure the tone you use doesn’t send messages you don’t intend. For example, an academic tone can make an app or game seem like it welcomes only high levels of education. As you seek the style that’s right for your experience, be clear, direct, and respectful.

**Pay attention to how you refer to people.** It typically works well to use _you_ and _your_ to address people directly. Referring to people indirectly as _the user_ or _the player_ can make your experience feel distant and unwelcoming. Also, consider reserving words like _we_ and _our_ to represent your software or company; otherwise, these terms can suggest a personal relationship with people that might be interpreted as insulting or condescending.

**Avoid using specialized or technical terms without defining them.** Using specialized or technical terms can make your writing more succinct, but doing so excludes people who don’t know what the terms mean. If you must use such terms, be sure to define them first and make the definitions easy for people to look up. Even when people know the definition of a specialized or technical term in a sentence, the sentence is easier to read — and translate — when it uses plain language instead.

**Replace colloquial expressions with plain language.** Colloquial expressions are often culture-specific and can be difficult to translate. Worse, some colloquial phrases have exclusionary meanings you might not know. For example, the phrases _peanut gallery_ and _grandfathered in_ both arose from oppressive contexts and continue to exclude people. Even when a colloquial phrase doesn’t have an exclusionary meaning, it can still exclude everyone who doesn’t understand it.

**Consider carefully before including humor.** Humor is highly subjective and — similar to colloquial expressions — difficult to translate from one culture to another. Including humor in your experience risks confusing people who donʼt understand it, irritating people who tire of repeatedly encountering it, and insulting people who interpret it differently. For additional writing guidance, see [Writing inclusively](https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/#/apdcb2a65d68).

## [Being approachable](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion\#Being-approachable)

An approachable app or game doesn’t require people to have particular skills or knowledge before they can use it, and it gives people a clear path toward deepening their understanding over time. Here are two ways to help make an experience approachable.

- Present a clear, straightforward interface. To help you design a simple interface that fits in with other experiences on each platform, see [Designing for iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-ios), [Designing for iPadOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-ipados), [Designing for macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-macos), [Designing for tvOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-tvos), [Designing for visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-visionos), [Designing for watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-watchos), and [Designing for games](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-games).

- Build in ways to learn how to use your app or game. Consider designing an onboarding flow that helps people who are new to your experience take a step-by-step approach while letting others skip straight to the content they want. For guidance, see [Onboarding](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/onboarding).

## [Gender identity](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion\#Gender-identity)

Throughout history, cultures around the world have recognized a spectrum of self-identity and expression that expands beyond the binary variants of woman and man.

You can help everyone feel welcome in your app or game by avoiding unnecessary references to specific genders. For example, a recipe-sharing app that uses copy like “You can let a subscriber post his or her recipes to your shared folder” could avoid unnecessary gender references by using an alternative like “Subscribers can post recipes to your shared folder.” In addition to using the gender-neutral noun “subscribers,” the revised copy avoids the unnecessary singular pronouns “his” and “her,” helping the sentence remain inclusive when it’s localized for languages that use gendered pronouns.

In addition, you can often avoid referencing a specific gender in an avatar, emoji, glyph, or game character. To welcome everyone to your app or game, prefer giving people the tools they need to customize such items as they choose.

If you need to depict a generic person or people, use a nongendered human image to reinforce the message that _generic person_ means _human_, not _man_ or _woman_. SF Symbols provides many nongendered glyphs you can use, such as the figure and person symbols shown here:

![A solid silhouette of a person from the shoulders up, within a circle.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/22f3909c1b433ca2181d2fdcf193fff7/person-crop-circle%402x.png)person.crop.circle

![Solid silhouettes of three people, with the left silhouette in the foreground and the other two in the background, all from the shoulders up.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5edbc84a409deb59e72f4d780b8e7b94/person-3-fill%402x.png)person.3.fill

![A solid silhouette of a person standing with an arm raised high on the left side of the image.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/ea7ebde0ec424a8dc74961a3670724b2/figure-wave%402x.png)figure.wave

Most apps and games don’t need to know a person’s gender, but if you require this information — such as for health or legal reasons — consider providing inclusive options, such as _nonbinary_, _self-identify_, and _decline to state_. In this situation, you could also let people specify the pronouns they use so you can address them properly when necessary.

## [People and settings](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion\#People-and-settings)

Portraying human diversity is one of the most noticeable ways your app or game can welcome everyone. When people recognize others like themselves within an experience and its related materials, they’re less likely to feel excluded and can be more likely to think they’ll benefit from it.

As you create copy and images that represent people, portray a range of human characteristics and activities. For example, a fitness app could feature exercise moves demonstrated by people with different racial backgrounds, body types, ages, and physical capabilities. If you need to depict occupations or behaviors, avoid stereotypical representations, such as showing only male doctors, female nurses, or heroes and villains that may perpetuate real-world racial or gender stereotypes.

Also review the settings and objects you show. For example, showing high levels of affluence might make sense in some scenarios, but in other cases it can be unwelcoming and make an experience seem out of touch. When it makes sense in your app or game, prefer showing places, homes, activities, and items that are familiar and relatable to most people.

## [Avoiding stereotypes](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion\#Avoiding-stereotypes)

Everyone holds biases and stereotypes — often unconsciously — and it can be challenging to discover how they affect your thoughts. A goal of inclusive design is to become aware of your biases and generalizations so you can recognize where they might influence your design decisions.

For example, consider an app that helps people manage account access for various family members. If this app uses a stereotypical definition of _family_ — such as a woman, a man, and their biological children — it’s likely to communicate this perspective in its copy and images. Because the app assumes that people’s families fit this narrow definition, it excludes everyone whose family is different.

Although the assumption made in the account-access app might seem like an obvious mistake, it’s important to realize that not all assumptions are so easy to spot. For example, consider an app or game that requires people to choose security questions they can answer for future identity confirmation, such as:

- What was your favorite subject in college?

- What was the make of your first car?

- How did you feel when you first saw a rainbow?

From some perspectives these questions refer to commonplace events, but all are based on experiences that not everyone has. Using a context-specific experience to communicate something is useless for everyone who doesn’t share that context and effectively excludes them. To create alternatives to the culture- and capability-specific questions above, you might reference more universal human experiences like:

- What’s your favorite activity?

- What was the name of your first friend?

- What quality describes you best?

Basing design decisions on stereotypes or assumptions inevitably leads to exclusion because generalizations can’t reflect the diversity of human perspectives. Avoiding assumptions and instead concentrating on inclusion can help you craft experiences that benefit everyone.

## [Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion\#Accessibility)

An inclusive app or game is accessible to everyone. People rely on Apple’s accessibility features — such as VoiceOver, Display Accommodations, closed captioning, Switch Control, and Speak Screen — to customize their devices for their individual needs, so it’s essential to support these features.

It’s also essential to avoid assuming that any disability might prevent someone from wanting to enjoy the experience your software provides. Making an assumption like this can result in designs that limit the potential audience for your app or game. In contrast, when you make each experience accessible, you give everyone the opportunity to benefit from your app or game in ways that work for them.

To help you design an app or game that everyone can enjoy, remember that:

- Each disability is a spectrum. For example, visual disabilities range from low vision to complete blindness, and include things like color blindness, blurry vision, light sensitivity, and peripheral vision loss.

- Everyone can experience disabilities. In addition to disabilities that most people experience as they age, there are _temporary disabilities_ — like short-term hearing loss due to an infection — and _situational disabilities_ — like being unable to hear while on a noisy train — that can affect everyone at various times.

As you design content that welcomes people of all abilities, consider the following tips.

**Avoid images and language that exclude people with disabilities.** For example, include people with disabilities when you represent a variety of people, and avoid language that uses a disability to express a negative quality.

**Take a people-first approach when writing about people with disabilities.** For example, you could describe an individual’s accomplishments and goals before mentioning a disability they may have. If you’re writing about a specific person or community, find out how they self-identify; for more guidance, see [Writing about disability](https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/#/apd49cbb2b06).

**Prioritize simplicity and perceivability.** Prefer familiar, consistent interactions that make tasks simple to perform, and ensure that everyone can perceive your content, whether they use sight, hearing, or touch.

To learn more about making your app or game accessible, see [Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility).

## [Languages](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion\#Languages)

People expect to customize their device by choosing a language for text and a region for formatting values like date, time, and money. To welcome a global audience, first prepare your software to handle languages and regions other than your own — a process called _internationalization_ — and provide translated text and resources for specific locales. For an overview of internationalization, see [Expanding your app to new markets](https://developer.apple.com/localization/); for developer guidance on localization, see [Localization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/localization).

Creating an inclusive experience can also help you prepare for localization. For example, using plain language, avoiding unnecessary gender references, representing a variety of people, and avoiding stereotypes and culture-specific content, can put you in a good position to create versions of your software localized into more languages. Using [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols) for the glyphs in your app or game can also help streamline localization. In addition to providing many language-specific glyphs, SF Symbols includes glyphs you can use in both left-to-right and right-to-left contexts; for guidance, see [Right to left](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left).

As you localize your app or game and related content, also be aware of the ways you use color. Colors often have strong culture-specific meanings, so it’s essential to discover how people respond to specific colors in each locale you support. In some places, for example, white is associated with death or grief, whereas in other places, it’s associated with purity or peace. If you use color as a way to communicate, make sure your color choices communicate the same thing in each version of your software.

# Spatial layout

Spatial layout techniques help you take advantage of the infinite canvas of Apple Vision Pro and present your content in engaging, comfortable ways.

![A sketch of axes in the X, Y, and Z dimensions, suggesting three-dimensional layout. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/e13737927c465ae264094aa019129252/foundations-spatial-layout-intro%402x.png)

## [Field of view](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout\#Field-of-view)

A person’s _field of view_ is the space they can see without moving their head. The dimensions of an individual’s field of view while wearing Apple Vision Pro vary based on factors like the way people configure the Light Seal and the extent of their peripheral acuity.

![A screenshot of a blank app window in visionOS. A series of concentric circles overlay the image, conveying 30-, 60-, and 90-degree fields of view.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/88086621da558b375ed5ef8ea0002283/visionos-field-of-view-layout%402x.png)

**Center important content within the field of view.** By default, visionOS launches an app directly in front of people, placing it within their field of view. In an immersive experience, you can help people keep their attention on important content by keeping it centered and not displaying distracting motion or bright, high-contrast objects in the periphery.

A dotted line animates from the person's eyes to the center of the window.

**Avoid anchoring content to the wearer’s head.** Although you generally want your app to stay within the field of view, anchoring content so that it remains statically in front of someone can make them feel stuck, confined, and uncomfortable, especially if the content obscures a lot of passthrough and decreases the apparent stability of their surroundings. Instead, anchor content in people’s space, giving them the freedom to look around naturally and view different objects in different locations.

## [Depth](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout\#Depth)

People rely on visual cues like distance, occlusion, and shadow to perceive depth and make sense of their surroundings. On Apple Vision Pro, the system automatically uses visual effects like color temperature, reflections, and shadow to help people perceive the depth of virtual content. When people move a virtual object in space — or when they change their position relative to that object — the visual effects change the object’s apparent depth, making the experience feel more lifelike.

Because people can view your content from any angle, incorporating small amounts of depth throughout your interface — even in standard windows — can help it look more natural. When you use SwiftUI, the system adds visual effects to views in a 2D window, making them appear to have depth. For developer guidance, see [Adding 3D content to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/adding-3d-content-to-your-app).

![A screenshot of a 2D Notes window in visionOS. A note titled Nature Walks is open on the trailing side of the view, with sketches of leaves accompanied by handwritten text descriptions.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/2b07a7f22124deaea6c2ce31a93d8833/visionos-spatial-layout-2d-window%402x.png)

If you need to present content with additional depth, you use RealityKit to create a 3D object (for developer guidance, see [RealityKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit)). You can display the 3D object anywhere, or you can use a _volume_, which is a component that displays 3D content. A volume is similar to a window, but without a visible frame. For guidance, see [visionOS volumes](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/windows#visionOS-volumes).

Video with custom controls.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout#)

**Provide visual cues that accurately communicate the depth of your content.** If visual cues are missing or they conflict with a person’s real-world experience, people can experience visual discomfort.

**Use depth to communicate hierarchy.** Depth helps an object appear to stand out from surrounding content, making it more noticeable. People also tend to notice changes in depth: for example, when a sheet appears over a window, the window recedes along the z-axis, allowing the sheet to come forward and become visually prominent.

**In general, avoid adding depth to text.** Text that appears to hover above its background is difficult to read, which slows people down and can sometimes cause vision discomfort.

**Make sure depth adds value.** In general, you want to use depth to clarify and delight — you don’t need to use it everywhere. As you add depth to your design, think about the size and relative importance of objects. Depth is great for visually separating large, important elements in your app, like making a tab bar or toolbar stand out from a window, but it may not work as well on small objects. For example, using depth to make a button’s symbol stand out from its background can make the button less legible and harder to use. Also review how often you use different depths throughout your app. People need to refocus their eyes to perceive each difference in depth, and doing so too often or quickly can be tiring.

## [Scale](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout\#Scale)

visionOS defines two types of scale to preserve the appearance of depth while optimizing usability.

_Dynamic scale_ helps content remain comfortably legible and interactive regardless of its proximity to people. Specifically, visionOS automatically increases a window’s scale as it moves away from the wearer and decreases it as the window moves closer, making the window appear to maintain the same size at all distances.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: An animation that shows a square representing an app window in a 3D space. The square animates to move back along its plane from its initial position. As it moves, it dynamically grows in size. A frame representing the original position remains visible for comparison. After the movement is complete, the entire environment rotates to convey that, from the viewer's angle, the window always remains the same size.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout#)

_Fixed scale_ means that an object maintains the same scale regardless of its proximity to people. A fixed-scale object appears smaller when it moves farther from the viewer along the z-axis, similar to the way an object in a person’s physical surroundings looks smaller when it’s far away than it does when it’s close up.

Video with custom controls.

Content description: An animation that shows a square representing an app window in a 3D space. The square animates to move back along its plane from its initial position. As it moves, it becomes smaller. A frame representing the original position remains visible for comparison. After the movement is complete, the entire environment rotates to convey that, from the viewer's angle, the window appears to have receded into the distance.

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout#)

To support dynamic scaling and the appearance of depth, visionOS defines a point as an angle, in contrast to other platforms, which define a point as a number of pixels that can vary with the [resolution](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/images#Resolution) of a 2D display.

**Consider using fixed scale when you want a virtual object to look exactly like a physical object.** For example, you might want to maintain the life-size scale of a product you offer so it can look more realistic when people view it in their space. Because interactive content needs to scale to maintain usability as it gets closer or farther away, prefer applying fixed scale sparingly, reserving it for noninteractive objects that need it.

## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout\#Best-practices)

**Avoid displaying too many windows.** Too many windows can obscure people’s surroundings, making them feel overwhelmed, constricted, and even uncomfortable. It can also make it cumbersome for people to relocate an app because it means moving a lot of windows.

**Prioritize standard, indirect gestures.** People can make an _indirect_ gesture without moving their hand into their field of view. In contrast, making a _direct_ gesture requires people to touch the virtual object with their finger, which can be tiring, especially when the object is positioned at or above their line of sight. In visionOS, people use indirect gestures to perform the standard gestures they already know. When you prioritize indirect gestures, people can use them to interact with any object they look at, whatever its distance. If you support direct gestures, consider reserving them for nearby objects that invite close inspection or manipulation for short periods of time. For guidance, see [Gestures > visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/gestures#visionOS).

**Rely on the Digital Crown to help people recenter windows in their field of view.** When people move or turn their head, content might no longer appear where they want it to. If this happens, people can press the [Digital Crown](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/digital-crown) when they want to recenter content in front of them. Your app doesn’t need to do anything to support this action.

**Include enough space around interactive components to make them easy for people to look at.** When people look at an interactive element, visionOS displays a visual hover effect that helps them confirm the element is the one they want. It’s crucial to include enough space around an interactive component so that looking at it is easy and comfortable, while preventing the hover effect from crowding other content. For example, place multiple, regular-size [buttons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/buttons#visionOS) so their centers are at least 60 points apart, leaving 16 points or more of space between them. Also, don’t let controls overlap other interactive elements or views, because doing so can make selecting a single element difficult.

**Let people use your app with minimal or no physical movement.** Unless some physical movement is essential to your experience, help everyone enjoy it while remaining stationary.

**Use the floor to help you place a large immersive experience.** If your immersive experience includes content that extends up from the floor, place it using a flat horizontal plane. Aligning this plane with the floor can help it blend seamlessly with people’s surroundings and provide a more intuitive experience.

To learn more about windows and volumes in visionOS, see [Windows > visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/windows#visionOS); for guidance on laying content within a window, see [Layout > visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout#visionOS).

# Immersive experiences

In visionOS, you can design apps and games that extend beyond windows and volumes, immersing people in your content.

![A sketch that suggests Apple Vision Pro. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/63fd96e56c2b19f4451f688728f0b013/foundations-immersive-experiences-intro%402x.png)

You can choose whether your visionOS app or game launches in the Shared Space or in a Full Space. In the _Shared Space_, your software runs alongside other experiences, and people can switch between them much as they do on a Mac; in a _Full Space_, your app or game runs alone, hiding other experiences and helping people immerse themselves in your content. Apps and games can support different types of immersion, and can transition fluidly between the Shared Space and a Full Space at any time.

## [Immersion and passthrough](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/immersive-experiences\#Immersion-and-passthrough)

In visionOS, people use passthrough to see their physical surroundings. _Passthrough_ provides real-time video from the device’s external cameras, helping people feel comfortable and connected to their physical context.

People can also use the [Digital Crown](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/digital-crown) at any time to manage app or game content or adjust passthrough. For example, people can press and hold the Digital Crown to recenter content in their field of view or double-click it to briefly hide all content and show passthrough for a clear view of their surroundings.

The system also helps people remain comfortable by automatically changing the opacity of content in certain situations. For example, if someone gets too close to a physical object in `mixed` immersion, the content in front of them dims briefly so they can see their immediate physical surroundings more clearly. In more immersive experiences — such as in the `progressive` and `full` styles described below — the system defines a boundary that extends about 1.5 meters from the initial position of the wearer’s head. As their head gets close to this boundary, the entire experience begins to fade and passthrough increases. When their head moves beyond this boundary, the immersive visuals are replaced in space by the app’s icon, and are restored when the wearer returns to their original location or recenters their view using the Digital Crown.

### [Immersion styles](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/immersive-experiences\#Immersion-styles)

When your app or game transitions to a Full Space, the system hides other apps so people can focus on yours. In a Full Space, you can display 3D content that isn’t bound by a window, in addition to content in standard windows and volumes. For developer guidance, see [`automatic`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ImmersionStyle/automatic).

visionOS offers several ways to immerse people in your content in the Shared Space as well as when you transition to a Full Space. For example, you can:

- **Use dimmed passthrough to bring attention to your content.** You can subtly dim or tint passthrough and other visible content to bring attention to your app in the Shared Space without hiding other apps and games, or create a more focused experience in a Full Space. While passthrough is tinted black by default, you can apply a custom tint color to create a dynamic experience in your app. For developer guidance, see [`SurroundingsEffect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/SurroundingsEffect).

![A screenshot of a window in the Shared Space.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/3aa6d97e5947c39a73cfd8dd7e9c4dff/immersive-spaces-shared-space-regular-content%402x.png)

![A screenshot of a highlighted window in the Shared Space with dimmed passthrough.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/d6645a2853d8dc87e99062f5f575222b/immersive-spaces-shared-space-dimmed-content%402x.png)

- **Create unbounded 3D experiences.** Use the `mixed` immersion style in a Full Space to blend your content with passthrough. When your app or game runs in a Full Space, you can request access to information about nearby physical objects and room layout, helping you display virtual content in a person’s surroundings. The `mixed` immersion style doesn’t define a boundary. Instead, when a person gets too close to a physical object, the system automatically makes nearby content semi-opaque to help them remain aware of their surroundings. For developer guidance, see [`mixed`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ImmersionStyle/mixed) and [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ARKit).

- **Use `progressive` immersion to blend your custom environment with a person’s surroundings.** You can use the `progressive` style in a Full Space to display a custom environment that partially replaces passthrough. You can also define a specific range of immersion that works best with your app or game, and display content in portrait or landscape orientation. While in your immersive experience, people can use the Digital Crown to adjust the amount of immersion within either the default range of 120- to 360-degrees or a custom range, if you specify one. The system automatically defines an approximately 1.5-meter boundary when an experience transitions to the `progressive` style. For developer guidance, see [`progressive`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ImmersionStyle/progressive).

[Play](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/immersive-experiences#)

- **Use `full` immersion to create a fully immersive experience.** You can use the `full` style in a Full Space to display a 360-degree custom environment that completely replaces passthrough and transports people to a new place. As with the `progressive` style, the system defines an approximately 1.5-meter boundary when a fully immersive experience starts. For developer guidance, see [`full`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ImmersionStyle/full).

![A screenshot of an app running in a Full Space using the mixed immersion style in visionOS.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/bb7e4d2d5f14673af8223f16b8ef8367/immersive-spaces-full-space-mixed-style%402x.png)Mixed immersion style in a Full Space blending in-app objects with real-world surroundings

## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/immersive-experiences\#Best-practices)

**Offer multiple ways to use your app or game.** In addition to giving people the freedom to choose their experiences, it’s essential to design your software to support the accessibility features people use to personalize the ways they interact with their devices. For guidance, see [Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility).

**Prefer launching your app or game in the Shared Space or using the `mixed` immersion style.** Launching in the Shared Space lets people reference your app or game while using other running software, and enables seamless switching between them. If your app or game provides a fully immersive or `progressive` style experience, launching in the `mixed` immersion style or with a window-based experience in the Shared Space gives people more control, letting them choose when to increase immersion.

**Reserve immersion for meaningful moments and content.** Not every task benefits from immersion, and not every immersive task needs to be fully immersive. Although people sometimes want to enter a different world, they often want to stay grounded in their surroundings while they’re using your app or game, and they can appreciate being able to use other software and system features at the same time. Instead of assuming that your app or game needs to be fully immersive most of the time, design ways for people to immerse themselves in the individual tasks and content that make your experience unique. For example, people can browse their albums in Photos using a familiar app window in the Shared Space, but when they want to examine a single photo, they can temporarily transition to a more immersive experience in a Full Space where they can expand the photo and appreciate its details.

**Help people engage with key moments in your app or game, regardless of the level of immersion.** Cues like dimming, tinting, [motion](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/motion), [scale](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout#Scale), and [Spatial Audio](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-audio#visionOS) can help draw people’s attention to a specific area of content, whether it’s in a window in the Shared Space or in a completely immersive experience in a Full Space. Start with subtle cues that gently guide people’s attention, strengthening the cues only when there’s a good reason to do so.

**Prefer subtle tint colors for passthrough.** In visionOS 2 and later, you can tint passthrough to help a person’s surroundings visually coordinate with your content, while also making their hands look like they belong in your experience. Avoid bright or dramatic tints that can distract people and diminish the sense of immersion. For developer guidance, see [`SurroundingsEffect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/SurroundingsEffect).

## [Promoting comfort](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/immersive-experiences\#Promoting-comfort)

**Be mindful of people’s visual comfort.** For example, although you can place 3D content anywhere while your app or game is running in a Full Space, prefer placing it within people’s [field of view](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/spatial-layout#Field-of-view). Also, make sure you display motion in comfortable ways while your software runs in a Full Space to avoid causing distraction, confusion, or discomfort. For guidance, see [Motion](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/motion).

**Choose a style of immersion that supports the movements people might make while they’re in your app or game.** It’s essential to choose the right style for your immersive experience because it allows the system to respond appropriately when people move. Although people can make minor physical movements while in an immersive experience — such as shifting their weight, turning around, or switching between sitting and standing — making excessive movements can cause the system to interrupt some experiences. In particular, avoid using the `progressive` or `full` immersion styles or transition back to the `mixed` immersion style if you think people might need to move beyond the 1.5-meter boundary.

**Avoid encouraging people to move while they’re in a progressive or fully immersive experience.** Some people may not want to move, or are unable to move because of a disability or their physical surroundings. Design ways for people to interact with content without moving. For example, let people bring a virtual object closer to them instead of expecting them to move closer to the object.

**If you use the `mixed` immersion style, avoid obscuring passthrough too much.** People use passthrough to help them understand and navigate their physical surroundings, so it’s important to avoid displaying virtual objects that block too much of their view. If your app or game displays virtual objects that could substantially obscure passthrough, use the `full` or `progressive` immersion styles instead of `mixed`.

**Adopt ARKit if you want to blend custom content with someone’s surroundings.** For example, you might want to integrate virtual content into someone’s surroundings or use the wearer’s hand positions to inform your experience. If you need access to these types of sensitive data, you must request people’s permission. For guidance, see [Privacy](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/privacy); for developer guidance, see [`SceneReconstructionProvider`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ARKit/SceneReconstructionProvider).

## [Transitioning between immersive styles](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/immersive-experiences\#Transitioning-between-immersive-styles)

**Design smooth, predictable transitions when changing immersion.** Help people prepare for different experiences by providing gentle transitions that let people visually track changes. Avoid sudden, jarring transitions that might be disorienting or uncomfortable. For developer guidance, see [`CoordinateSpaceProtocol`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/CoordinateSpaceProtocol).

**Let people choose when to enter or exit a more immersive experience.** It can be disorienting for someone to suddenly enter a more immersive experience when they’re not expecting it. Instead, provide a clear action to enter or exit immersion so people can decide when to be more immersed in your content, and when to leave. For example, Keynote provides a prominent Exit button in its fully immersive Rehearsal environment to help people return to the slide-viewing window. Avoid requiring people to use system controls to reduce immersion in your experience.

**Indicate the purpose of an exit control.** Make sure your button clarifies whether it returns people to a previous, less immersive context or quits an experience altogether. If exiting your immersive experience also quits your app or game, consider providing controls that let people pause or return to a place where they can save their progress before quitting.

## [Displaying virtual hands](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/immersive-experiences\#Displaying-virtual-hands)

When your immersive app or game transitions to a Full Space, it can ask permission to hide a person’s hands and instead show virtual hands that represent them.

**Prefer virtual hands that match familiar characteristics.** For example, match the positions and gestures of the viewer’s hands so they can continue to interact with your app or game in ways that feel natural. Hands that work in familiar ways help people stay immersed in the experience when in fully virtual worlds.

**Use caution if you create virtual hands that are larger than the viewer’s hands.** Virtual hands that are significantly bigger than human hands can prevent people from seeing the content they’re interested in and can make interactions feel clumsy. Also, large virtual hands can seem out of proportion with the space, appearing to be too close to the viewer’s face.

**If there’s an interruption in hand-tracking data, fade out virtual hands and reveal the viewer’s own hands.** Don’t let the virtual hands become unresponsive and appear frozen. When hand-tracking data returns, fade the virtual hands back in.

## [Creating an environment](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/immersive-experiences\#Creating-an-environment)

When your app or game transitions to a Full Space, you can replace passthrough with a custom environment that partially or completely surrounds a person, transporting them to a new place. The following guidelines can help you design a beautiful environment that people appreciate.

**Minimize distracting content.** To help immerse people in a primary task like watching a video, avoid displaying a lot of movement or high-contrast details in your environment. Alternatively, when you want to draw people’s attention to certain areas of your environment, consider techniques like using the highest quality textures and shapes in the important area while using lower quality assets and dimming in less important areas.

**Help people distinguish interactive objects in your environment.** People often use an object’s proximity to help them decide if they can interact with it. For example, when you place a 3D object far away from people, they often don’t try to touch or move toward it, but when you place a 3D object close to people, they’re more likely to try interacting with it.

**Keep animation subtle.** Small, gentle movements, like clouds drifting or transforming, can enrich your custom environment without distracting people or making them uncomfortable. Always avoid displaying too much movement near the edges of a person’s field of view. For guidance, see [Motion](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/motion).

**Create an expansive environment, regardless of the place it depicts.** A small, restrictive environment can make people feel uncomfortable and even claustrophobic.

**Use Spatial Audio to create atmosphere.** In visionOS, you use Spatial Audio to play sound that people can perceive as coming from specific locations in space, not just from speakers (for guidance, see [Playing audio](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-audio)). As you design a soundscape that enhances your custom environment, keep the experience fresh and captivating by avoiding too much repetition or looping. If people can play other audio while they’re in your environment — for example, while watching a movie — be sure to lower the volume of the soundscape or stop it completely.

**In general, avoid using a flat 360-degree image to create your environment.** A 360-degree image doesn’t tend to give people a sense of scale when they view it in an environment, so it can reduce the immersiveness of the experience. Prefer creating object meshes that include lighting, and use shaders to implement subtle animations like the movements of clouds or leaves or the reflections of objects.

**Help people feel grounded.** Always provide a ground plane mesh so people don’t feel like they’re floating. If you must use a flat 360-degree image in your environment, adding a ground plane mesh can help it feel more realistic.

**Minimize asset redundancy.** Using the same assets or models too frequently tends to make an environment feel less realistic.
